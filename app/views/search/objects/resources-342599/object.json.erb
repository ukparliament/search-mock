Since then the boundaries of the \nDarlington constituency have gradually extended to reflect the growth of the town of \nDarlington.  The parts of the modern constituency that were at one time beyond the \nboundaries, particularly in the nineteenth century, formed part of the county constituencies \nsurrounding Darlington.  The boundaries of the Darlington constituency have changed very \nlittle since 1950.  The latest boundary changes following the Fifth Periodical Review of \nParliamentary constituencies in England, implemented at the 2010 general election, \ntransferred approximately 670 voters from the Sedgefield constituency to the Darlington \nconstituency. \n \n \n \nSince the Second World War the Darlington constituency has returned mostly Labour MPs.  \nThe exceptions were when Conservative MPs were returned between 1951 and 1964 (Sir \nFergus Graham 1951-1959 and Anthony Bourne-Arton 1959-1964) and from 1983 to 1992 \n(Michael Fallon).  Between 1950 to 1997 the constituency was won by more than 5,000 votes \non only one occasion.  In 1992 Alan Milburn won the seat from Michael Fallon by 2,798 \n(Fallon went on to become the MP for Sevenoaks, in Kent).  Milburn held the seat at the \nthree subsequent elections and the seat is generally regarded as a safe Labour seat at the \nmoment. \nIn his Parliamentary career Alan Milburn was a front bench spokesman for the Labour Party \nfrom 1995 until 1997.  Following Labour’s general election victory in 1997 he was appointed \na Minister of State at the Department of Health.  The following year he was promoted to the \n3 \n\n\nCabinet and held three different posts, including Health Secretary, before resigning as a \nMinister in 2005.  In June 2009 he announced his intention not to seek re-election to the \nHouse of Commons at the next general election to “pursue challenges other than politics”.1 \nAt the 2010 general election the Darlington constituency was won by Jenny Chapman of the \nLabour Party.  She won with a majority of 3,388 votes. \n2 Early Representation \nUnlike many of the ancient counties, the people of Durham were not directly represented in \nParliament until the sixteenth century, in the reign of Henry VIII.  Parliaments of the knights of \nthe shires were summoned by the Monarch from the thirteenth century.  It was these \nParliaments summoned by writ to meet that were generally regarded as the first assemblies \nof representatives.2  County Durham was a County Palatine.  This is defined as “county or \nother territory in England…as having a ruler with royal privileges and judicial authority (within \nthe territory) which elsewhere belong to the sovereign alone”.3  Durham’s status as a County \nPalatine dates back to the Norman period and the power was held by the Bishops of Durham \nwho had the title Prince Bishop to denote the royal authority they exercised.  The Prince \nBishop held civil and military power and established courts and issued money.  Part of the \nreason for these special privileges was the proximity to Scotland and the remoteness from \nthe Monarch.  In an emergency the Prince Bishop could act to protect the county without \ndelay.4   \nCounty Durham appears in the returns twice in the Parliaments of 1654 and 1656.  These \nwere the Protectorate Parliaments that followed Oliver Cromwell’s Instrument of Government \nthat declared Cromwell Lord Protector.  The Instrument was an attempt to redistribute seats \non a more equitable basis.5  Durham’s representation was suspended following the \nRestoration in 1660 and power returned to the Prince Bishop but Members were again \nreturned to the Parliament of 1661 summoned by Charles II.  An Act of Parliament in 1672 \nconfirmed both the city and county of Durham’s representation in the English Parliament from \n1678.6  The returns for Durham for Cromwell’s Parliament summoned in 1654 did not survive \nbut the two county Members from the 1656 Parliament are named as Thomas Lilburne and \nJames Clavering.7  The pattern of representation remained unaltered until the reforms of \n1832, with four Members returned to Parliament, two to represent the county and two to \nrepresent the city of Durham. \n3 Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Changes \n3.1 Great Reform Act of 1832 \nThe Representation of the People Act 1832 was the Act that reformed the distribution of \nseats in England and Wales. It introduced the principle of splitting the shire counties into \ndivisions and returning two Members for each division rather than for the whole county and it \nalso reformed the Parliamentary boroughs that were entitled to send Members to \n \n \n1  Gaby Hinsliff, The Observer, June 2009, p13 \n2  House of Commons Information Office, Factsheet G3 A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons. \n3  http://dictionary.oed.com/entrance.dtl accessed 22 April 2008. \n4  Robert Surtees, History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham, 1816-40, ppxv-xvii \n5  Ivan Roots, The Great Rebellion 1642-1660, 1995, pp181-9 \n6  J Holladay Philbin, Parliamentary Representation 1832: England and Wales, 1965, pp67-70 \n7  House of Commons, Returns of Parliament Vol I 1213-1702, Ordered to be printed 1 March 1878 \n4 \n\n\nParliament.8  The City of Durham retained its status as a Parliamentary borough with the \nright to return two Members.  In addition Sunderland was established as a two Member \nParliamentary borough, and Gateshead and South Shields became single Member \nParliamentary boroughs.  Darlington was not granted separate Parliamentary representation. \nDurham was divided into two divisions, each of which returned two MPs.  The Boundary \nCommission proposals that followed the Act, published in 1832, made recommendations on \nthe boundaries of the Parliamentary boroughs and divisions of counties that had been listed \nin Schedule F.9  The recommendations of the Boundary Commission were implemented by \nthe Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832.10  These changes gave the county a total of ten \nseats in the reformed House of Commons.  This was an increase of six from the pre-1832 \narrangements. \nThe county was already divided into four wards and the Boundary Commission decided to \nuse them to split the county.  The Northern division of the county comprised the Chester and \nEasington wards, with the Southern division comprised of the Darlington and Stockton wards.  \nBoth divisions of the county were exclusive of the areas included within the four \nParliamentary boroughs.  They also excluded the isolated parts of Durham that lay between \nNewcastle and Berwick.  Those areas, Norhamshire, Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire were \nannexed to Northumberland for the purposes of Parliamentary representation.  This meant \nthat Darlington was represented by the two MPs for the Southern division of the county of \nDurham after 1832. \n3.2 Boundary Commission Review 1868 \nThe 1868 review carried out by the Boundary Commission followed the Representation of the \nPeople Act 1867. This Act appointed the Commission to inquire into the boundaries of the \nnew boroughs created by the Act; the counties the Act had newly divided, and to review all \nother existing boroughs that had not been disenfranchised by the Act. In inquiring into \nexisting boroughs, the Commissioners had the power to recommend extension of borough \nboundaries if it thought this was appropriate. This Act also increased the number of Members \nrepresenting each of the growing industrial cities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and \nLiverpool, from two to three.11 The Commissioners conducted local inquiries and reported in \n1868. \nIn county Durham none of the existing Parliamentary boroughs were abolished and the \nnumbers of seats in these boroughs were left unchanged.  The city of Durham and \nSunderland had their boundaries extended but South Shields was unaltered.  Three new \nParliamentary boroughs were created:  Darlington, the Hartlepools, and Stockton.  All three \nwere designated single Member boroughs.   \nThe two county divisions remained unaltered except for those areas that had been absorbed \ninto the extended or newly created Parliamentary boroughs.  This meant that the total \nnumber of Members in the county increased to thirteen as a result of the creation of the three \nnew boroughs. \nThe new Parliamentary borough of Darlington was temporarily defined as comprising the \ntownships of Darlington, Haughton-le-Skerne, and Cockerton by the RPA 1867.  However, \n \n \n8  Representation of the People Act 1832, (2 Will 4, chapter 45) \n9  Parliamentary Representation Boundary Reports in Eighteen Volumes, 1831-2 \n10  Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 (2 and 3 Will 4 chapter 64) \n11  Representation of the People Act 1867 (30 and 31 Vict chapter 102) \n5 \n\n\nthe Boundary Act 1868, which implemented any alterations resulting from the Boundary \nCommission inquiries, defined the Parliamentary borough of Darlington as being the same as \nthe municipal borough of Darlington.12  This excluded Cockerton and Haughton.  It also \nexcluded Blackwell in the south.  The western boundary was Baydale Beck, with Cocker \nBeck forming the north western boundary.  In the north east the river Skerne marked the \nborough boundary and the northern limit of the borough, along the North Road, was \napproximately where Thompson Street is today.  The southern boundary approximated to the \nmodern route of Consicliffe Road in the west but extended further south in the east to include \nthe area around the modern location of Darlington Cricket Club.  A small area of Oxen-le-\nFields was administratively part of Darlington but was excluded from the Parliamentary \nborough. \nThe boundaries of Darlington implemented in 1868 meant that some parts of the modern \nconstituency lay beyond the boundary.  These areas continued to be represented by the two \nMPs for the Southern division of the county of Durham. \n3.3 Boundary Commission Review 1885 \nThe next review occurred in 1885. In major cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham \nthere was a major change to the distribution of seats. Until now these had been \nparliamentary boroughs returning multiple members. The Redistribution of Seats Bill made \nprovision for larger boroughs to be divided into single Member divisions. A Boundary \nCommission was established to recommend boundaries while the Bill was still going through \nParliament. The Commission was appointed in November 1884 and reported in February \n1885.13 The recommendations were incorporated into the Bill which became the \nRedistribution of Seats Act 1885.14 \nThere were two alterations to the Parliamentary boroughs in the county of Durham.  Durham \ncity was reduced to a single Member seat and the borough of Darlington had its boundaries \naltered. \nThe Act also altered representation in many of the counties.  Several counties were divided \ninto single Member divisions. Durham was one such county and the Act divided the areas of \nthe county not included in Parliamentary boroughs into eight divisions.  This gave the county \na total of sixteen Members, a net increase of three.  The constituencies created contained a \nmix of petty sessional divisions and parishes.  Petty sessional divisions were the \ngeographical area of operation of magistrates’ courts within counties for the administration of \nlocal summary justice.  These have since been replaced by fewer and larger modern petty \nsessional areas.15 \nThe borough boundaries of Darlington had not grown significantly so the area of the \nParliamentary borough saw only minor adjustment.  The areas not included in the borough \nformed part of a new constituency named South East Durham. \n \n \n12  Boundary Act 1868 ( 31 and 32 Vict chapter 46) \n13  Boundary Commission for England and Wales Report, C 4287, 1885 \n14  Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 (48 & 49 Vict chapter 23) \n15   Bryan Gibson, Introduction to the Magistrates’ Court, 4th Ed, 2001, pp14,17 \n6 \n\n\n3.4 Boundary Commission Review 1917 \nThe next Boundary Commission review reported in 1917,16 and the results were incorporated \ninto the Representation of the People Act 1918.17 The Act made many changes to \nconstituencies and elections in the UK. \nIn this review the Boundary Commission used local government administrative areas, as they \nexisted at the time, to construct constituencies.  There was also far less detail printed than in \nmodern reviews.  This makes direct comparison with other reviews difficult. \nIn Durham county, the city of Durham was abolished as a Parliamentary borough and was \nmerged into the county seats.  The other six boroughs were retained, with Sunderland \nretaining two Members and all the others each returning a single Member.  The county at \nlarge was divided into eleven single Member constituencies.  This gave the county a total of \neighteen seats. \nThe Parliamentary borough of Darlington was extended to include the whole of the municipal \nborough of Darlington, which had grown since the 1885 review.  The borough had been \nextended to include most of Cockerton and parts of Haughton, although most of Haughton \nremained as a separate parish.  This meant that an increased area of the modern \nconstituency was within the boundaries of the Parliamentary borough created by this review.  \nThe areas not included in the borough, including the parish of Haughton, formed part of a \nnew constituency named Sedgefield. \n4 Boundary Commission Periodical Reviews \nThe regular reviews of Parliamentary constituencies have their origins in the House of \nCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944. This Act instructed the Boundary Commission \nfor England to conduct an initial review of all seats with a view to keeping them under \nconstant review. One of the Rules in this review was that all two Member boroughs should be \ndivided and return a single Member for each division unless the Commission felt it \n“undesirable to divide it”. The recommendations of the initial review were published in \n1947.18 This formed the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1948.19 The following \nyear the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 was passed, which repealed \nthe 1944 Act, but took the principle of periodic review forward and established the rules for \nthe reviews. 20  \n \nIn county Durham the situation in the Parliamentary boroughs remained largely unaltered.  \nThe only real difference was that Sunderland was split into two single Member constituencies \nrather than the whole borough returning two Members, as had been the case since 1832.  \nThe other five Parliamentary boroughs continued to be single Member constituencies.  The \nremaining parts of the county were divided into ten single Member constituencies.  This was \na reduction of one. \nBy the time of the Initial Review the borough of Darlington had grown again.  The boundaries \nof the constituency of Darlington were adjusted to make them coterminous with the borough.  \nIt meant that the constituency boundaries were recognisable as those that still exist today.  \n \n16  Boundary Commission (England & Wales) Report and Appendices, Cd 8756, 1917 \n17  Representation of the People Act 1918, (7 & 8 Geo V, chapter 64) \n18  Boundary Commission for England Constituted in accordance with the House of Commons (Redistribution of \nSeat) Act 1944 Initial Report, Cmd 7260, October 1947 \n19  Representation of the People Act 1948, (11 & 12 Geo 6, chapter 65) \n20  The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 (12 & 13 Geo 6 chapter 66) \n7 \n\n\nThe maps provided with the earlier reviews are not sufficiently detailed to draw exact \nconclusions but only a small number of electors currently in the Darlington constituency \nwould have been beyond the constituency boundary at this time.  The area surrounding \nDarlington was again allocated to the Sedgefield constituency. \n4.1 First Periodical Review \nThe first full periodical review followed in 1953-4 with the report published in 1954.21  This \nreview divided the Gateshead constituency and altered the Jarrow constituency.  The \nremaining fifteen constituencies were unaltered.  These new boundaries were first used in \nthe 1955 general election. \n4.2 Second Periodical Review \nThe Second Periodical Review was published in 1969, having commenced in February \n1965.22  Since the previous review the county borough of Teesside had been created.  This \ncovered the Redcar, Middlesborough, Stockton and Thornaby area and the borough was part \nof the North Riding of Yorkshire.  This meant Stockton was no longer considered part of \nDurham.  As a result the county was allocated one seat fewer than in the previous review, \ntaking the county total to sixteen \nThe Boundary Commission noted that a Royal Commission on local government in England \nwas likely to make major changes to the Tyneside area so the Commission decided to make \nas little alteration as possible to the Parliamentary constituency boundaries in this review.  \nThe Darlington constituency was adjusted to realign the constituency boundaries with the \nborough boundaries, which had been altered in 1967.  The Boundary Commission report \nnoted this as a minor change but gave no detail.  The area surrounding the Darlington \nconstituency was transferred to the Bishop Auckland constituency following the abolition of \nthe Sedgefield constituency. \nThe 1969 recommendations were not implemented until after the 1970 general election, so \nthe new boundaries were not used until the general elections of 1974. For more detail see \nResearch Paper 92/61 The Parliamentary Boundary Commissions and the Boundary \nCommissions Bill.  \n4.3 Third Periodical Review \nThe next periodical review commenced in 1976, and the report was published in 1983.23  \nSince the last review the Local Government Act 1972 had been implemented, which had \naltered many of the administrative boundaries across the country.  This had a significant \nimpact on the county of Durham.  The Tyneside areas of Gateshead, Jarrow and South \nShields, in the north of the county, were combined with Sunderland, Houghton and \nWashington and transferred to the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.  A new non-\nmetropolitan county of Cleveland was created southeast of Durham.  Hartlepool and the rural \ndistrict of Stockton were transferred to Cleveland.  The remainder of the old county of \nDurham was combined with the rural district of Startforth, in the old North Riding Yorkshire, to \ncreate a new county of Durham.24 \n \n \n21  Boundary Commission for England First Periodical Report, Cmd 9311, November 1954 \n22  Boundary Commission for England Second Periodical Report, Cmnd 4084, June 1969 \n23  Boundary Commission for England Third Periodical Report, Cmnd 8797, February 1983 \n24  Local Government Act 1972 (chapter 70) \n8 \n\n\nThe Act also revised the local administrative structure within the modified county.  It defined \nthe area covered by the county, but gave the Secretary of State for the Environment the \npower to define and name the new structure of local councils by order at a later date.  The \nmunicipal boroughs and rural districts were abolished and new districts were created using \nthe definitions contained in the English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972.25  \nThe existing borough of Darlington was merged with part of the surrounding rural district to \nform the new borough of Darlington.26  New local electoral wards were then implemented in \n1976.27 \nThe Boundary Commission allocated the modified county seven constituencies.  The \nBoundary Commission initially recommended that the Darlington constituency should be \nenlarged to include three of the five rural wards that now formed part of the new borough of \nDarlington, Hurworth, Middleton St George, and Sadberge as they existed at the time.  \nFollowing a local inquiry the proposal was dropped and the Darlington constituency was \nretained with the same boundaries as before and comprised all but five wards of the borough \nof Darlington.  The five rural wards of the borough of Darlington were instead allocated to the \nSedgefield constituency re-established as a result of this review.  The new boundaries were \nimplemented by order in 1983.28 They were used in the 1983, 1987 and 1992 general \nelections. \n4.4 Fourth Periodical Review \nThe Fourth Periodical Review commenced in February 1991 and reported to Parliament in \nJune 1995.29  Durham was allocated seven seats.  The Darlington constituency was \nunaltered by the review and continued to comprise all but five of the borough’s wards.  The \nfive rural wards remained allocated to the Sedgefield constituency although there were \nboundary changes elsewhere in the Sedgefield constituency.  These boundaries were \nimplemented by order in 199530, and used in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections. \n4.5 Fifth Periodical Review \nThe Fifth Periodical Review of constituencies in England commenced in February 2000 and \nwas published in February 2007.  The final recommendations adopted by the Commission \nand approved by Parliament were used at the 2010 general election. \nThere had been two significant developments in the county by the time of the Fifth Review.  \nAll the local government districts of the county had been re-warded in 1999 along with those \nof Darlington in 2001.31  The Boundary Commission had to realign boundaries to take into \naccount any alterations that had led to Parliamentary boundaries no longer being \ncoterminous with ward boundaries.  In addition the Durham (Borough of Darlington) \n(Structural Changes) Order 1995 had created the new unitary authority of Darlington, which \nnow had county status in its own right, and was no longer administratively part of the county \nof Durham.32 \n \n \n25  English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972 SI 1972/2039 \n26  English Non-metropolitan District (Names) Order 1973 SI 1973/551 \n27   Borough of Darlington (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1976 SI 1976/832 \n28  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1983, SI 1983/417 \n29  Boundary Commission for England Fourth Periodical Report, Cm 433, 6 June 1995 \n30  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1995, SI 1995/1626 \n31  Borough of Darlington (Electoral Changes) Order 2001 SI 2001/3357 \n32  Durham (Borough of Darlington) (Structural Changes) Order 1995 SI 1995/1772 \n9 \n\n\nThe Boundary Commission decided to review county Durham and Darlington together.  They \nnoted that it would not affect the overall allocation of seats, but by reviewing the areas \ntogether the option of minimal changes would be available.  If Darlington had been reviewed \nas a separate review area this would have required greater disruption to Parliamentary \nboundaries. \nIn the Darlington constituency the Boundary Commission recommended that there should be \nminimal realignment to the constituency boundaries to take into account the new ward \nboundaries.  This required two alterations.  The Harrowgate Hill ward had been enlarged to \ntake in an area formerly in the Whessoe ward.  The Harrowgate ward remained allocated to \nthe Darlington constituency which meant that 375 electors were transferred from the \nSedgefield constituency to the Darlington constituency.  A new ward named Faverdale had \nbeen created and it too included an area formerly included in the Whessoe wards as well as \nincluding some of the old Cockerton East ward.  The Faverdale ward was allocated to the \nDarlington constituency which meant 295 electors were transferred to the Darlington \nconstituency. \nA local inquiry into the proposals for Durham and Darlington was required.  The principal \nissue in relation to Darlington was whether Darlington should be reviewed separately or as \npart of the combined review area.  If Darlington was reviewed as a single area it would \nproduce a single constituency coterminous with the borough.  The Assistant Commissioner \nconducting the inquiry reported that this would not necessarily produce an excessive \ndisparity in the electorates of the constituencies in Durham and Darlington but there was \nsignificant approval for the Commission’s initial recommendations to keep the four rural \nwards of Darlington in the Sedgefield constituency (the ward restructuring had reduced the \nnumber of wards covering the rural parts of Darlington from five to four).  The Assistant \nCommissioner therefore recommended that the Commission’s initial proposals for Darlington \nshould stand and be adopted as the final recommendation to be put to Parliament. \nThe draft Order approving the Boundary Commission’s final recommendations was laid \nbefore Parliament on 26 February 2007 and was subject to the affirmative procedure. The \nHouse of Commons considered the draft Order on 27 March 2007 in the Fourth Delegated \nLegislation Committee33 and was formally approved by the House on 16 April 2007.34  The \nHouse of Lords approved the draft Order on 17 May 200735 with the approved Order being \nmade on 13 June 2007 and coming into force 14 days after that.36  The full details of the \nprovisional recommendations and the local inquiry can be viewed on an archive of the \nBoundary Commission website.37 \n \n \n33  SC Deb (4DLC) 27 March 2007 c3-26 \n34  HC Deb 16 April 2007, c131-2 \n35  HL Deb 17 May 2007, c380-3 \n36  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order  SI 2007/1681 \n37  http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100221151902/http://www.boundarycommissionforenglan \nd.org.uk/index.shtml \n10 \n\n\n5 Previous Members \nThe following lists give details of Members who have represented the area now broadly \ncovered by the constituency.38,39,40,41  For biographical details of Members pre-1979 see \nStenton and Lees’ various volumes.42 Biographical details of Members from 1979 – 2010 are \navailable in Research Paper 2010/33 Members 1979 - 2010.43 \n1832-1885 Southern Durham (County division with two seats) \nDates Election Members Party \n1832 General election Joseph Pease  \nJohn Bowes \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1835 General election John Bowes  \nJoseph Pease \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1837 General election John Bowes \nJoseph Pease \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1841 General election Lord Harry Vane \nJohn Bowes \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1847 General election James Farrer \nLord Harry Vane \nConservative \nLiberal \n1852 General election James Farrer \nLord Harry Vane \nConservative \nLiberal \n1857 General election Henry Pease \nLord Harry Vane \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1859 General election James Farrer \nHenry Pease \nConservative \nLiberal \n1865 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nCharles Surtees \nLiberal \nConservative \n \n \n38  FWS Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1932 – 1885, 1977; British Parliamentary Results 1885-\n1918, 1974;  British Parliamentary Election Results 1918 - 1949, 1983; British Parliamentary Election Results  \n1950 – 1973,  1983; British Parliamentary Election Results 1974 – 1983, 1984 \n39  Rallings and Thrasher, British Parliamentary Election Results 1983 – 1997, 1999, Britain Votes 6: British \nParliamentary Election Results, 1997, 1998 \n40  Electoral Commission, Election 2001: The Official Results, 2001 \n41  Times Guide to the House of Commons 2005, 2005 \n42  Stenton and Lees, Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament Volume I, 1832-1885, 1976; Who’s Who of \nBritish Members of Parliament Volume II 1886-1918, 1978;Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament \nVolume III 1919-1945, 1979 and Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament Volume IV1945-79, 1981 \n43  Oonagh Gay, House of Commons Library Research Paper 2010/33, Members 1979 - 2010 \n11 \n\n\n1868 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nFrederick Beaumont \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1874 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nFrederick Beaumont \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1880 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nHon.

It should be \nnoted that the units used to comprise the constituency have altered over time so are not \ndirectly comparable.  Where parish or ward names remain unaltered it should not be implied \nthat the geographical area remains static.  Parish and ward boundaries have been altered \nover the years by various Orders.   \n1950, 1951, 1955, 1959, 1960, 1964, 1966 and 1970 elections \nBorough \nDarlington \n \n1974(Feb), 1974(Oct) and 1979 elections \nBorough \nDarlington as altered by the Darlington Order 1967 \n \n1983, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001 and 2005 elections \nBorough of Darlington Wards \nBank Top \nCentral \nCockerton East \nCockerton West \nCollege \nEastbourne North \nEastbourne South \nHarrowgate Hill \nHaughton East \nHaughton West \nHummersknott \nLascelles \nLingfield \nMowden \nNorthgate North \n19 \n\n\n20 \nNorthgate South \nNorth Road \nPark East \nPark West \nPierremont \n \n2010 election \nBorough of Darlington Wards \nBank Top \nCentral \nCockerton East \nCockerton West \nCollege \nEastbourne \nFaverdale \nHarrowgate Hill \nHaughton East \nHaughton North \nHaughton West \nHummersknott \nLascelles \nLingfield \nMowden \nNorthgate \nNorth Road \nPark East \nPark West \nPierremont \n \n\n\n\n"],"description_s":["This note outlines the history of Parliamentary representation in the Darlington constituency"],"description_t":["This note outlines the history of Parliamentary representation in the Darlington constituency"],"abstract_s":["This note outlines the history of Parliamentary representation in the Darlington constituency"],"title_s":["Constituency History: Darlington"],"subject_ses":[90689,9566],"containsAttachment_b":[false],"dateFirstIndexed_dt":["2010-10-18T00:00:00Z"],"publisher_sesrollup":[61054,25259,28766,25267,351453,61054,25259,28766,25267],"htmlsummary_s":["&lt;p&gt;This note outlines the history of Parliamentary representation in the Darlington constituen"],"created_dt":["2010-10-17T23:00:00Z"],"all_ses":[346697,90689,9566,25267,294075,61055,414033],"internalLocation_uri":["http://researchbriefings.intranet.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05471"],"all_uri":["http://researchbriefings.intranet.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05471","http://researchbriefingsapp.parliament.uk/resourcefile/get/7c2efe7b-0f7e-40bb-b9a7-209cb12876e2/SN05471_7142.pdf","http://data.parliament.uk/resources/342599/briefingDocument"],"subtype_ses":[414033],"type_ses":[346697],"creator_ses":[294075],"publisherSnapshot_s":["House of Commons Library"],"publisherSnapshot_t":["House of Commons Library"],"creator_sesrollup":[294075],"indexStatus_s":["Indexed"],"indexStatus_t":["Indexed"],"modified_dt":["2010-10-17T23:00:00Z"],"firstIndexedBy_t":["bp-migration"],"published_b":[true],"contentLocation_uri":["http://researchbriefingsapp.parliament.uk/resourcefile/get/7c2efe7b-0f7e-40bb-b9a7-209cb12876e2/SN05471_7142.pdf"],"firstIndexedBy_s":["bp-migration"],"humanIndexable_b":[true],"status_t":["published"],"status_s":["published"]}]},"highlighting":{"http://data.parliament.uk/resources/342599":{}}}
