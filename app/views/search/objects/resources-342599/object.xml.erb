1 Introduction 
Darlington is a borough constituency in the unitary authority of the borough of Darlington.  
Darlington ceased to be part of the county of Durham following structural changes in 1995.  
The Darlington constituency is formed of the urban wards that cover the town of Darlington.  
The four rural wards of the borough of Darlington form part of the Sedgefield constituency. 
The Darlington constituency was first created in 1868.  Since then the boundaries of the 
Darlington constituency have gradually extended to reflect the growth of the town of 
Darlington.  The parts of the modern constituency that were at one time beyond the 
boundaries, particularly in the nineteenth century, formed part of the county constituencies 
surrounding Darlington.  The boundaries of the Darlington constituency have changed very 
little since 1950.  The latest boundary changes following the Fifth Periodical Review of 
Parliamentary constituencies in England, implemented at the 2010 general election, 
transferred approximately 670 voters from the Sedgefield constituency to the Darlington 
constituency. 
 
 
 
Since the Second World War the Darlington constituency has returned mostly Labour MPs.  
The exceptions were when Conservative MPs were returned between 1951 and 1964 (Sir 
Fergus Graham 1951-1959 and Anthony Bourne-Arton 1959-1964) and from 1983 to 1992 
(Michael Fallon).  Between 1950 to 1997 the constituency was won by more than 5,000 votes 
on only one occasion.  In 1992 Alan Milburn won the seat from Michael Fallon by 2,798 
(Fallon went on to become the MP for Sevenoaks, in Kent).  Milburn held the seat at the 
three subsequent elections and the seat is generally regarded as a safe Labour seat at the 
moment. 
In his Parliamentary career Alan Milburn was a front bench spokesman for the Labour Party 
from 1995 until 1997.  Following Labour’s general election victory in 1997 he was appointed 
a Minister of State at the Department of Health.  The following year he was promoted to the 
3 


Cabinet and held three different posts, including Health Secretary, before resigning as a 
Minister in 2005.  In June 2009 he announced his intention not to seek re-election to the 
House of Commons at the next general election to “pursue challenges other than politics”.1 
At the 2010 general election the Darlington constituency was won by Jenny Chapman of the 
Labour Party.  She won with a majority of 3,388 votes. 
2 Early Representation 
Unlike many of the ancient counties, the people of Durham were not directly represented in 
Parliament until the sixteenth century, in the reign of Henry VIII.  Parliaments of the knights of 
the shires were summoned by the Monarch from the thirteenth century.  It was these 
Parliaments summoned by writ to meet that were generally regarded as the first assemblies 
of representatives.2  County Durham was a County Palatine.  This is defined as “county or 
other territory in England…as having a ruler with royal privileges and judicial authority (within 
the territory) which elsewhere belong to the sovereign alone”.3  Durham’s status as a County 
Palatine dates back to the Norman period and the power was held by the Bishops of Durham 
who had the title Prince Bishop to denote the royal authority they exercised.  The Prince 
Bishop held civil and military power and established courts and issued money.  Part of the 
reason for these special privileges was the proximity to Scotland and the remoteness from 
the Monarch.  In an emergency the Prince Bishop could act to protect the county without 
delay.4   
County Durham appears in the returns twice in the Parliaments of 1654 and 1656.  These 
were the Protectorate Parliaments that followed Oliver Cromwell’s Instrument of Government 
that declared Cromwell Lord Protector.  The Instrument was an attempt to redistribute seats 
on a more equitable basis.5  Durham’s representation was suspended following the 
Restoration in 1660 and power returned to the Prince Bishop but Members were again 
returned to the Parliament of 1661 summoned by Charles II.  An Act of Parliament in 1672 
confirmed both the city and county of Durham’s representation in the English Parliament from 
1678.6  The returns for Durham for Cromwell’s Parliament summoned in 1654 did not survive 
but the two county Members from the 1656 Parliament are named as Thomas Lilburne and 
James Clavering.7  The pattern of representation remained unaltered until the reforms of 
1832, with four Members returned to Parliament, two to represent the county and two to 
represent the city of Durham. 
3 Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Changes 
3.1 Great Reform Act of 1832 
The Representation of the People Act 1832 was the Act that reformed the distribution of 
seats in England and Wales. It introduced the principle of splitting the shire counties into 
divisions and returning two Members for each division rather than for the whole county and it 
also reformed the Parliamentary boroughs that were entitled to send Members to

Parliament.8  The City of Durham retained its status as a Parliamentary borough with the 
right to return two Members.  In addition Sunderland was established as a two Member 
Parliamentary borough, and Gateshead and South Shields became single Member 
Parliamentary boroughs.  Darlington was not granted separate Parliamentary representation. 
Durham was divided into two divisions, each of which returned two MPs.  The Boundary 
Commission proposals that followed the Act, published in 1832, made recommendations on 
the boundaries of the Parliamentary boroughs and divisions of counties that had been listed 
in Schedule F.9  The recommendations of the Boundary Commission were implemented by 
the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832.10  These changes gave the county a total of ten 
seats in the reformed House of Commons.  This was an increase of six from the pre-1832 
arrangements. 
The county was already divided into four wards and the Boundary Commission decided to 
use them to split the county.  The Northern division of the county comprised the Chester and 
Easington wards, with the Southern division comprised of the Darlington and Stockton wards.  
Both divisions of the county were exclusive of the areas included within the four 
Parliamentary boroughs.  They also excluded the isolated parts of Durham that lay between 
Newcastle and Berwick.  Those areas, Norhamshire, Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire were 
annexed to Northumberland for the purposes of Parliamentary representation.  This meant 
that Darlington was represented by the two MPs for the Southern division of the county of 
Durham after 1832. 
3.2 Boundary Commission Review 1868 
The 1868 review carried out by the Boundary Commission followed the Representation of the 
People Act 1867. This Act appointed the Commission to inquire into the boundaries of the 
new boroughs created by the Act; the counties the Act had newly divided, and to review all 
other existing boroughs that had not been disenfranchised by the Act. In inquiring into 
existing boroughs, the Commissioners had the power to recommend extension of borough 
boundaries if it thought this was appropriate. This Act also increased the number of Members 
representing each of the growing industrial cities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and 
Liverpool, from two to three.11 The Commissioners conducted local inquiries and reported in 
1868. 
In county Durham none of the existing Parliamentary boroughs were abolished and the 
numbers of seats in these boroughs were left unchanged.  The city of Durham and 
Sunderland had their boundaries extended but South Shields was unaltered.  Three new 
Parliamentary boroughs were created:  Darlington, the Hartlepools, and Stockton.  All three 
were designated single Member boroughs.   
The two county divisions remained unaltered except for those areas that had been absorbed 
into the extended or newly created Parliamentary boroughs.  This meant that the total 
number of Members in the county increased to thirteen as a result of the creation of the three 
new boroughs. 
The new Parliamentary borough of Darlington was temporarily defined as comprising the 
townships of Darlington, Haughton-le-Skerne, and Cockerton by the RPA 1867.  However,

11  Representation of the People Act 1867 (30 and 31 Vict chapter 102)

the Boundary Act 1868, which implemented any alterations resulting from the Boundary 
Commission inquiries, defined the Parliamentary borough of Darlington as being the same as 
the municipal borough of Darlington.12  This excluded Cockerton and Haughton.  It also 
excluded Blackwell in the south.  The western boundary was Baydale Beck, with Cocker 
Beck forming the north western boundary.  In the north east the river Skerne marked the 
borough boundary and the northern limit of the borough, along the North Road, was 
approximately where Thompson Street is today.  The southern boundary approximated to the 
modern route of Consicliffe Road in the west but extended further south in the east to include 
the area around the modern location of Darlington Cricket Club.  A small area of Oxen-le-
Fields was administratively part of Darlington but was excluded from the Parliamentary 
borough. 
The boundaries of Darlington implemented in 1868 meant that some parts of the modern 
constituency lay beyond the boundary.  These areas continued to be represented by the two 
MPs for the Southern division of the county of Durham. 
3.3 Boundary Commission Review 1885 
The next review occurred in 1885. In major cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham 
there was a major change to the distribution of seats. Until now these had been 
parliamentary boroughs returning multiple members. The Redistribution of Seats Bill made 
provision for larger boroughs to be divided into single Member divisions. A Boundary 
Commission was established to recommend boundaries while the Bill was still going through 
Parliament. The Commission was appointed in November 1884 and reported in February 
1885.13 The recommendations were incorporated into the Bill which became the 
Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.14 
There were two alterations to the Parliamentary boroughs in the county of Durham.  Durham 
city was reduced to a single Member seat and the borough of Darlington had its boundaries 
altered. 
The Act also altered representation in many of the counties.  Several counties were divided 
into single Member divisions. Durham was one such county and the Act divided the areas of 
the county not included in Parliamentary boroughs into eight divisions.  This gave the county 
a total of sixteen Members, a net increase of three.  The constituencies created contained a 
mix of petty sessional divisions and parishes.  Petty sessional divisions were the 
geographical area of operation of magistrates’ courts within counties for the administration of 
local summary justice.  These have since been replaced by fewer and larger modern petty 
sessional areas.15 
The borough boundaries of Darlington had not grown significantly so the area of the 
Parliamentary borough saw only minor adjustment.  The areas not included in the borough 
formed part of a new constituency named South East Durham.

3.4 Boundary Commission Review 1917 
The next Boundary Commission review reported in 1917,16 and the results were incorporated 
into the Representation of the People Act 1918.17 The Act made many changes to 
constituencies and elections in the UK. 
In this review the Boundary Commission used local government administrative areas, as they 
existed at the time, to construct constituencies.  There was also far less detail printed than in 
modern reviews.  This makes direct comparison with other reviews difficult. 
In Durham county, the city of Durham was abolished as a Parliamentary borough and was 
merged into the county seats.  The other six boroughs were retained, with Sunderland 
retaining two Members and all the others each returning a single Member.  The county at 
large was divided into eleven single Member constituencies.  This gave the county a total of 
eighteen seats. 
The Parliamentary borough of Darlington was extended to include the whole of the municipal 
borough of Darlington, which had grown since the 1885 review.  The borough had been 
extended to include most of Cockerton and parts of Haughton, although most of Haughton 
remained as a separate parish.  This meant that an increased area of the modern 
constituency was within the boundaries of the Parliamentary borough created by this review.  
The areas not included in the borough, including the parish of Haughton, formed part of a 
new constituency named Sedgefield. 
4 Boundary Commission Periodical Reviews 
The regular reviews of Parliamentary constituencies have their origins in the House of 
Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944. This Act instructed the Boundary Commission 
for England to conduct an initial review of all seats with a view to keeping them under 
constant review. One of the Rules in this review was that all two Member boroughs should be 
divided and return a single Member for each division unless the Commission felt it 
“undesirable to divide it”. The recommendations of the initial review were published in 
1947.18 This formed the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1948.19 The following 
year the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 was passed, which repealed 
the 1944 Act, but took the principle of periodic review forward and established the rules for 
the reviews. 20  
 
In county Durham the situation in the Parliamentary boroughs remained largely unaltered.  
The only real difference was that Sunderland was split into two single Member constituencies 
rather than the whole borough returning two Members, as had been the case since 1832.  
The other five Parliamentary boroughs continued to be single Member constituencies.  The 
remaining parts of the county were divided into ten single Member constituencies.  This was 
a reduction of one. 
By the time of the Initial Review the borough of Darlington had grown again.  The boundaries 
of the constituency of Darlington were adjusted to make them coterminous with the borough.  
It meant that the constituency boundaries were recognisable as those that still exist today.

The maps provided with the earlier reviews are not sufficiently detailed to draw exact 
conclusions but only a small number of electors currently in the Darlington constituency 
would have been beyond the constituency boundary at this time.  The area surrounding 
Darlington was again allocated to the Sedgefield constituency. 
4.1 First Periodical Review 
The first full periodical review followed in 1953-4 with the report published in 1954.21  This 
review divided the Gateshead constituency and altered the Jarrow constituency.  The 
remaining fifteen constituencies were unaltered.  These new boundaries were first used in 
the 1955 general election. 
4.2 Second Periodical Review 
The Second Periodical Review was published in 1969, having commenced in February 
1965.22  Since the previous review the county borough of Teesside had been created.  This 
covered the Redcar, Middlesborough, Stockton and Thornaby area and the borough was part 
of the North Riding of Yorkshire.  This meant Stockton was no longer considered part of 
Durham.  As a result the county was allocated one seat fewer than in the previous review, 
taking the county total to sixteen 
The Boundary Commission noted that a Royal Commission on local government in England 
was likely to make major changes to the Tyneside area so the Commission decided to make 
as little alteration as possible to the Parliamentary constituency boundaries in this review.  
The Darlington constituency was adjusted to realign the constituency boundaries with the 
borough boundaries, which had been altered in 1967.  The Boundary Commission report 
noted this as a minor change but gave no detail.  The area surrounding the Darlington 
constituency was transferred to the Bishop Auckland constituency following the abolition of 
the Sedgefield constituency. 
The 1969 recommendations were not implemented until after the 1970 general election, so 
the new boundaries were not used until the general elections of 1974. For more detail see 
Research Paper 92/61 The Parliamentary Boundary Commissions and the Boundary 
Commissions Bill.  
4.3 Third Periodical Review 
The next periodical review commenced in 1976, and the report was published in 1983.23  
Since the last review the Local Government Act 1972 had been implemented, which had 
altered many of the administrative boundaries across the country.  This had a significant 
impact on the county of Durham.  The Tyneside areas of Gateshead, Jarrow and South 
Shields, in the north of the county, were combined with Sunderland, Houghton and 
Washington and transferred to the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.  A new non-
metropolitan county of Cleveland was created southeast of Durham.  Hartlepool and the rural 
district of Stockton were transferred to Cleveland.  The remainder of the old county of 
Durham was combined with the rural district of Startforth, in the old North Riding Yorkshire, to 
create a new county of Durham.24

The Act also revised the local administrative structure within the modified county.  It defined 
the area covered by the county, but gave the Secretary of State for the Environment the 
power to define and name the new structure of local councils by order at a later date.  The 
municipal boroughs and rural districts were abolished and new districts were created using 
the definitions contained in the English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972.25  
The existing borough of Darlington was merged with part of the surrounding rural district to 
form the new borough of Darlington.26  New local electoral wards were then implemented in 
1976.27 
The Boundary Commission allocated the modified county seven constituencies.  The 
Boundary Commission initially recommended that the Darlington constituency should be 
enlarged to include three of the five rural wards that now formed part of the new borough of 
Darlington, Hurworth, Middleton St George, and Sadberge as they existed at the time.  
Following a local inquiry the proposal was dropped and the Darlington constituency was 
retained with the same boundaries as before and comprised all but five wards of the borough 
of Darlington.  The five rural wards of the borough of Darlington were instead allocated to the 
Sedgefield constituency re-established as a result of this review.  The new boundaries were 
implemented by order in 1983.28 They were used in the 1983, 1987 and 1992 general 
elections. 
4.4 Fourth Periodical Review 
The Fourth Periodical Review commenced in February 1991 and reported to Parliament in 
June 1995.29  Durham was allocated seven seats.  The Darlington constituency was 
unaltered by the review and continued to comprise all but five of the borough’s wards.  The 
five rural wards remained allocated to the Sedgefield constituency although there were 
boundary changes elsewhere in the Sedgefield constituency.  These boundaries were 
implemented by order in 199530, and used in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections. 
4.5 Fifth Periodical Review 
The Fifth Periodical Review of constituencies in England commenced in February 2000 and 
was published in February 2007.  The final recommendations adopted by the Commission 
and approved by Parliament were used at the 2010 general election. 
There had been two significant developments in the county by the time of the Fifth Review.  
All the local government districts of the county had been re-warded in 1999 along with those 
of Darlington in 2001.31  The Boundary Commission had to realign boundaries to take into 
account any alterations that had led to Parliamentary boundaries no longer being 
coterminous with ward boundaries.  In addition the Durham (Borough of Darlington) 
(Structural Changes) Order 1995 had created the new unitary authority of Darlington, which 
now had county status in its own right, and was no longer administratively part of the county 
of Durham.32

The Boundary Commission decided to review county Durham and Darlington together.  They 
noted that it would not affect the overall allocation of seats, but by reviewing the areas 
together the option of minimal changes would be available.  If Darlington had been reviewed 
as a separate review area this would have required greater disruption to Parliamentary 
boundaries. 
In the Darlington constituency the Boundary Commission recommended that there should be 
minimal realignment to the constituency boundaries to take into account the new ward 
boundaries.  This required two alterations.  The Harrowgate Hill ward had been enlarged to 
take in an area formerly in the Whessoe ward.  The Harrowgate ward remained allocated to 
the Darlington constituency which meant that 375 electors were transferred from the 
Sedgefield constituency to the Darlington constituency.  A new ward named Faverdale had 
been created and it too included an area formerly included in the Whessoe wards as well as 
including some of the old Cockerton East ward.  The Faverdale ward was allocated to the 
Darlington constituency which meant 295 electors were transferred to the Darlington 
constituency. 
A local inquiry into the proposals for Durham and Darlington was required.  The principal 
issue in relation to Darlington was whether Darlington should be reviewed separately or as 
part of the combined review area.  If Darlington was reviewed as a single area it would 
produce a single constituency coterminous with the borough.  The Assistant Commissioner 
conducting the inquiry reported that this would not necessarily produce an excessive 
disparity in the electorates of the constituencies in Durham and Darlington but there was 
significant approval for the Commission’s initial recommendations to keep the four rural 
wards of Darlington in the Sedgefield constituency (the ward restructuring had reduced the 
number of wards covering the rural parts of Darlington from five to four).  The Assistant 
Commissioner therefore recommended that the Commission’s initial proposals for Darlington 
should stand and be adopted as the final recommendation to be put to Parliament. 
The draft Order approving the Boundary Commission’s final recommendations was laid 
before Parliament on 26 February 2007 and was subject to the affirmative procedure. The 
House of Commons considered the draft Order on 27 March 2007 in the Fourth Delegated 
Legislation Committee33 and was formally approved by the House on 16 April 2007.34  The 
House of Lords approved the draft Order on 17 May 200735 with the approved Order being 
made on 13 June 2007 and coming into force 14 days after that.36  The full details of the 
provisional recommendations and the local inquiry can be viewed on an archive of the 
Boundary Commission website.37

Appendix 
 
This appendix shows the composition of the Darlington constituency as defined by the 
various Periodical Reviews for general elections since the Second World War.  It should be 
noted that the units used to comprise the constituency have altered over time so are not 
directly comparable.  Where parish or ward names remain unaltered it should not be implied 
that the geographical area remains static.  Parish and ward boundaries have been altered 
over the years by various Orders.
