    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My hon Friend the Minister of State for Housing and Planning (Brandon Lewis) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to update hon. Members on the action that the Coalition Government has taken to free up the planning system and the further new measures we are now implementing to support small scale developers and help hard-working people get the home they want by reducing disproportionate burdens on developer contributions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 106 obligations imposed on small scale developers, custom and self-builders
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consulted in March this year on a series of measures intended to tackle the disproportionate burden of developer contributions on small scale developers, custom and self-builders. These included introducing into national policy a threshold beneath which affordable housing contributions should not be sought. The suggested threshold was for developments of ten-units or less (and which have a maximum combined gross floor space of no more than 1,000 square metres).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also proposed a similar policy for affordable housing contributions be applied to all residential extensions and annexes. Rural Exception Sites would be exempted from any threshold introduced following consultation. Our consultation asked whether the threshold should be extended to include the tariff style contributions that some authorities seek in order to provide general funding pots for infrastructure. We also consulted on restricting the application of affordable housing contributions to vacant buildings being brought back into use (other than for any increase in floor space). This latter proposal was to boost development on brownfield land and provide consistency with exemptions from the Community Infrastructure Levy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We received over 300 consultation responses many of which contained detailed submissions and local data. After careful consideration of these responses, the Government is making the following changes to national policy with regard to Section 106 planning obligations:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the disproportionate burden of developer contributions on small scale developers, for sites of 10-units or less, and which have a maximum combined gross floor space of 1,000 square metres, affordable housing and tariff style contributions should not be sought. This will also apply to all residential annexes and extensions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For designated rural areas under Section 157 of the Housing Act 1985, which includes National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, authorities may choose to implement a lower threshold of 5-units or less, beneath which affordable housing and tariff style contributions should not be sought. This will also apply to all residential annexes and extensions. Within these designated areas, if the 5-unit threshold is implemented then payment of affordable housing and tariff style contributions on developments of between 6 to 10 units should also be sought as a cash payment only and be commuted until after completion of units within the development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes in national planning policy will not apply to Rural Exception Sites which, subject to the local area demonstrating sufficient need, remain available to support the delivery of affordable homes for local people. However, affordable housing and tariff style contributions should not be sought in relation to residential annexes and extensions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A financial credit, equivalent to the existing gross floorspace of any vacant buildings brought back into any lawful use or demolished for re-development, should be deducted from the calculation of any affordable housing contributions sought from relevant development schemes. This will not however apply to vacant buildings which have been abandoned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will publish revised planning guidance to assist authorities in implementing these changes shortly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By lowering the construction cost of small-scale new build housing and home improvements, these reforms will help increase housing supply. In particular, they will encourage development on smaller brownfield sites and help to diversify the house building sector by providing a much-needed boost to small and medium-sized developers, which have been disproportionately affected by the Labour Government’s 2008 housing crash. The number of small-scale builders has fallen to less than 3,000 – down from over 6,000 in 1997.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimate that the policy will save, on average, £15,000 in Section 106 housing contributions per new dwelling in England – some councils are charging up to £145,000 on single dwellings. Further savings will be made from tariffs, which may add additional charges of more than £15,000 per dwelling, over and above any housing contributions. Taken together, these changes will deliver six-figure savings for small-scale developers in some parts of the country.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Home Builders Federation confirmed that these changes will provide a boost to small and medium builders, stating:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exemption would offer small and medium-sized developers a shot in the arm. The time and expense of negotiating Section 106 affordable housing contributions on small sites, and the subsequent payments, can threaten the viability of small developments and act as another barrier to the entry and growth of smaller firms”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Federation of Master Builders said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new ten unit threshold for affordable housing contributions is a sensible and proportionate approach to help alleviate the pressure on SME house builders who have been squeezed out of the housing market in recent years. This is important because without a viable SME house building sector we won"t be able to build the number of new homes that are needed to address the housing crisis”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting custom and self-build housing
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes to Section 106 policy complement the Coalition Government’s wider programme of reforms to get Britain Building, including measures to actively support the custom and self-build sector that will help people design and build their own home.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we have exempted custom and self-builders from paying the Community Infrastructure Levy. The £30 million investment fund for Custom Build Homes has so far approved or is currently considering loan funding of £13 million. We have launched a new £150 million investment fund to help provide up to 10,000 serviced building plots. The first bidding round closed in September and applications received are currently being assessed by the Homes and Communities Agency.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition we continue to work in partnership with industry to provide better support and information to custom and self-builders and we are helping community-led custom projects by enabling them to apply for £65 million under the Affordable Housing Guarantee programme and £14 million of project support funding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also providing £525 million through the Builders’ Finance Fund (2015-16 to 2016-17) to provide development finance to unlock stalled small housing sites. A shortlist of 165 small housing schemes was announced on 8 September. We are also opening up the Builders Finance Fund to support small building firms schemes, from 5 units in size upwards.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also published a consultation on the Right to Build in October. The idea is simple: prospective custom builders will have a right to purchase a plot of land from their local Council to build their own home. To underpin the consultation we are working with a network of eleven Right to Build Vanguards to test how the Right can work in practice and we are supporting the hon. Member for South Norfolk’s (Richard Bacon) Self-Build and Custom Housebuilding Private Members’ Bill which has now passed its Second Reading in this House.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting empty and redundant land and property back into use
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have introduced a range of measures to help communities get empty and surplus land and property back into productive use.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have reformed permitted development rights to cut through complexity, free up the planning system and encourage the conversion of existing buildings. The changes help support town centres, the rural economy and provide much-needed homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to Community Infrastructure Levy rules now provide an increased incentive for brownfield development, through exempting empty buildings being brought back into use. To assist extensions and home improvements, we have also exempted them from Community Infrastructure Levy, stopped plans for a so-called ‘conservatory tax’, stopped any council tax revaluation which would have taxed home improvements, and introduced a new national council tax discount for family annexes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect implementation of these measures to have a significant positive impact on housing numbers by unlocking small scale development and boosting the attractiveness of brownfield sites. This will provide real incentive for small builders and to people looking to build their own home. They will increase house building and help reduce the cost of such housing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These latest policy changes illustrate how this Government continues to deliver the reform to our planning system which will enable more houses to be built, giving more power to local communities, helping people move on to and up the housing ladder.

This will also apply to all residential annexes and extensions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For designated rural areas under Section 157 of the Housing Act 1985, which includes National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, authorities may choose to implement a lower threshold of 5-units or less, beneath which affordable housing and tariff style contributions should not be sought. This will also apply to all residential annexes and extensions. Within these designated areas, if the 5-unit threshold is implemented then payment of affordable housing and tariff style contributions on developments of between 6 to 10 units should also be sought as a cash payment only and be commuted until after completion of units within the development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes in national planning policy will not apply to Rural Exception Sites which, subject to the local area demonstrating sufficient need, remain available to support the delivery of affordable homes for local people. However, affordable housing and tariff style contributions should not be sought in relation to residential annexes and extensions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A financial credit, equivalent to the existing gross floorspace of any vacant buildings brought back into any lawful use or demolished for re-development, should be deducted from the calculation of any affordable housing contributions sought from relevant development schemes. This will not however apply to vacant buildings which have been abandoned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will publish revised planning guidance to assist authorities in implementing these changes shortly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By lowering the construction cost of small-scale new build housing and home improvements, these reforms will help increase housing supply. In particular, they will encourage development on smaller brownfield sites and help to diversify the house building sector by providing a much-needed boost to small and medium-sized developers, which have been disproportionately affected by the Labour Government’s 2008 housing crash. The number of small-scale builders has fallen to less than 3,000 – down from over 6,000 in 1997.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimate that the policy will save, on average, £15,000 in Section 106 housing contributions per new dwelling in England – some councils are charging up to £145,000 on single dwellings. Further savings will be made from tariffs, which may add additional charges of more than £15,000 per dwelling, over and above any housing contributions. Taken together, these changes will deliver six-figure savings for small-scale developers in some parts of the country.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Home Builders Federation confirmed that these changes will provide a boost to small and medium builders, stating:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exemption would offer small and medium-sized developers a shot in the arm. The time and expense of negotiating Section 106 affordable housing contributions on small sites, and the subsequent payments, can threaten the viability of small developments and act as another barrier to the entry and growth of smaller firms”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Federation of Master Builders said:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new ten unit threshold for affordable housing contributions is a sensible and proportionate approach to help alleviate the pressure on SME house builders who have been squeezed out of the housing market in recent years. This is important because without a viable SME house building sector we won"t be able to build the number of new homes that are needed to address the housing crisis”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting custom and self-build housing
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes to Section 106 policy complement the Coalition Government’s wider programme of reforms to get Britain Building, including measures to actively support the custom and self-build sector that will help people design and build their own home.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we have exempted custom and self-builders from paying the Community Infrastructure Levy. The £30 million investment fund for Custom Build Homes has so far approved or is currently considering loan funding of £13 million. We have launched a new £150 million investment fund to help provide up to 10,000 serviced building plots. The first bidding round closed in September and applications received are currently being assessed by the Homes and Communities Agency.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition we continue to work in partnership with industry to provide better support and information to custom and self-builders and we are helping community-led custom projects by enabling them to apply for £65 million under the Affordable Housing Guarantee programme and £14 million of project support funding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also providing £525 million through the Builders’ Finance Fund (2015-16 to 2016-17) to provide development finance to unlock stalled small housing sites. A shortlist of 165 small housing schemes was announced on 8 September. We are also opening up the Builders Finance Fund to support small building firms schemes, from 5 units in size upwards.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also published a consultation on the Right to Build in October. The idea is simple: prospective custom builders will have a right to purchase a plot of land from their local Council to build their own home. To underpin the consultation we are working with a network of eleven Right to Build Vanguards to test how the Right can work in practice and we are supporting the hon. Member for South Norfolk’s (Richard Bacon) Self-Build and Custom Housebuilding Private Members’ Bill which has now passed its Second Reading in this House.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting empty and redundant land and property back into use
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have introduced a range of measures to help communities get empty and surplus land and property back into productive use.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have reformed permitted development rights to cut through complexity, free up the planning system and encourage the conversion of existing buildings. The changes help support town centres, the rural economy and provide much-needed homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to Community Infrastructure Levy rules now provide an increased incentive for brownfield development, through exempting empty buildings being brought back into use. To assist extensions and home improvements, we have also exempted them from Community Infrastructure Levy, stopped plans for a so-called ‘conservatory tax’, stopped any council tax revaluation which would have taxed home improvements, and introduced a new national council tax discount for family annexes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect implementation of these measures to have a significant positive impact on housing numbers by unlocking small scale development and boosting the attractiveness of brownfield sites. This will provide real incentive for small builders and to people looking to build their own home. They will increase house building and help reduce the cost of such housing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These latest policy changes illustrate how this Government continues to deliver the reform to our planning system which will enable more houses to be built, giving more power to local communities, helping people move on to and up the housing ladder.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the serious fiscal crisis faced by the new Afghan Government, the UK agreed to make £15.6 million of previously committed funding available more quickly to the Government of Afghanistan. This is not new money. It will be delivered through the World Bank managed Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, and will allow basic services to continue to be delivered to the people of Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK and Afghan Government agreed the London Conference on Afghanistan will take place on 3/4 December.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend the Under Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and Minister for Intellectual Property (Baroness Neville-Rolfe) has today made the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) took place in Brussels on 21 November 2014.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I represented the UK on all the issues discussed at the meeting. A summary of those discussions follows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU’s High Representative Vice President addressed the Council to say she hoped to participate as much as possible in future Trade FACs in order to co-ordinate trade and foreign policy, emphasising among other things the political aspects of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) implementation with the eastern neighbourhood.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two legislative items were discussed:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of the European Union against dumped imports.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency and the Commission expressed disappointment that no compromise has been found between member states on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, along with the other trade liberals, reiterated that no package could be considered balanced that restricted the use of the Lesser Duty Rule (LDR). I reminded the Council that EU producers and consumers had been saved millions of euros thanks to the LDR, and limiting it could harm EU growth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some member states argued that removing the LDR in certain circumstances would create a level playing field. Other member states took positions between these. The presidency concluded more work was needed on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Procurement Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency took stock of progress on the International Procurement Instrument (intended to permit the EU to close a procurement market where a non-EU country’s procurement market was similarly closed). The presidency highlighted its compromise proposals, which reflected the European Parliament’s amendments, and reiterated that access to the EU’s public procurement market needed to be used as leverage in negotiations with third countries. The presidency invited the Commission and European Parliament to consider further. Trade Commissioner Malmstrom spoke in support of the Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Legislative items:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTO - Doha Development Agenda (DDA).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other member states I warmly supported the Commission’s report that the DDA work programme implementing the outcome of the December 2013 9 Ministerial Conference in Bali seemed set to get back on track, following the recent agreement between the US and India on how to unblock the stalemate relating to food security in the proposed trade facilitation agreement. Along with other member states, I warmly supported this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP— the EU-US Free Trade Agreement).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency (Calenda) emphasised the economic and systemic importance of the deal. The aim remained to conclude an ambitious agreement rapidly, ahead of a change in US administration. TTIP was also a way to unlock growth without spending taxpayers’ money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade Commissioner Malmstrom reiterated her transparency announcement of earlier in the week, that access to TTIP texts would be expanded and TTIP negotiating proposals would be made public. Busting myths was agreed as important. For example, it was agreed that TTIP would not threaten national public services, such as the NHS, as policy over such public services would remain a matter for member states.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All member states agreed on the importance of the deal. I urged the Commission to use the window of opportunity before the end of the President Obama Administration, and welcomed plans for increased transparency.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU-Japan and EU-Vietnam.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Malmstrom presented the state-of-play in the negotiations with Japan. The FTA, worth potentially over €40 billion (£31 billion) to the EU in the long term, was a high priority. Discussions had been challenging recently but successful and would now speed up. Both sides wanted to reach political agreement in 2015.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend the Under Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and Minister for Intellectual Property (Baroness Neville-Rolfe) has today made the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) took place in Brussels on 21 November 2014.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I represented the UK on all the issues discussed at the meeting. A summary of those discussions follows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU’s High Representative Vice President addressed the Council to say she hoped to participate as much as possible in future Trade FACs in order to co-ordinate trade and foreign policy, emphasising among other things the political aspects of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) implementation with the eastern neighbourhood.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two legislative items were discussed:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of the European Union against dumped imports.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency and the Commission expressed disappointment that no compromise has been found between member states on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, along with the other trade liberals, reiterated that no package could be considered balanced that restricted the use of the Lesser Duty Rule (LDR). I reminded the Council that EU producers and consumers had been saved millions of euros thanks to the LDR, and limiting it could harm EU growth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some member states argued that removing the LDR in certain circumstances would create a level playing field. Other member states took positions between these. The presidency concluded more work was needed on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Procurement Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency took stock of progress on the International Procurement Instrument (intended to permit the EU to close a procurement market where a non-EU country’s procurement market was similarly closed). The presidency highlighted its compromise proposals, which reflected the European Parliament’s amendments, and reiterated that access to the EU’s public procurement market needed to be used as leverage in negotiations with third countries. The presidency invited the Commission and European Parliament to consider further. Trade Commissioner Malmstrom spoke in support of the Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Legislative items:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTO - Doha Development Agenda (DDA).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other member states I warmly supported the Commission’s report that the DDA work programme implementing the outcome of the December 2013 9 Ministerial Conference in Bali seemed set to get back on track, following the recent agreement between the US and India on how to unblock the stalemate relating to food security in the proposed trade facilitation agreement. Along with other member states, I warmly supported this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP— the EU-US Free Trade Agreement).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency (Calenda) emphasised the economic and systemic importance of the deal. The aim remained to conclude an ambitious agreement rapidly, ahead of a change in US administration. TTIP was also a way to unlock growth without spending taxpayers’ money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade Commissioner Malmstrom reiterated her transparency announcement of earlier in the week, that access to TTIP texts would be expanded and TTIP negotiating proposals would be made public. Busting myths was agreed as important. For example, it was agreed that TTIP would not threaten national public services, such as the NHS, as policy over such public services would remain a matter for member states.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All member states agreed on the importance of the deal. I urged the Commission to use the window of opportunity before the end of the President Obama Administration, and welcomed plans for increased transparency.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU-Japan and EU-Vietnam.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Malmstrom presented the state-of-play in the negotiations with Japan. The FTA, worth potentially over €40 billion (£31 billion) to the EU in the long term, was a high priority. Discussions had been challenging recently but successful and would now speed up. Both sides wanted to reach political agreement in 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the EU-Vietnam FTA, the Commissioner reported that negotiations were going well and remained confident about conclusion in spring 2015.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend the Under- Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and Minister for intellectual property (Baroness Neville-Rolfe) has today made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) will take place in Brussels on 21 November 2014. Baroness Neville-Rolfe will represent the UK on all the issues on the agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be two substantive items on the agenda:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending European Council regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on how to protect the European Union against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. (Dumped goods are those imported into the European Union at unfairly low prices which cause significant harm to European competitors); and European Council regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protecting European companies against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission proposed a trade defence (anti-dumping, anti-subsidy) instruments modernisation package in April 2013. This comprises regulatory and non-regulatory proposals, on issues such as the period of notice of imposition of trade defence measures, reimbursement of duties paid by importers when measures are not renewed, and increased assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council making it easier for non-EU goods and services to enter the European Union’s internal market in public procurement, and procedures supporting negotiations to make it easier for European Union goods and services to enter the public procurement markets of non-EU countries. This is an orientation debate on a proposal that aims to restrict the access of non-EU countries to our domestic procurement markets where they do not open their markets to ours.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also expect updates or discussions on the following non-legislative items:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest state of play with the World Trade Organisation’s Doha Development Agenda trade round (which aims to improve the trading prospects of all countries but particularly developing countries) in view of the agreement reached between the US and India on the decision on stockpiling for food security purposes; and the latest state of play on the implementation of the trade facilitation agreement (streamlining of customs and trade procedures) agreed in Bali in December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU-US TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement negotiations aimed at reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade between the EU and the US;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on an EU economic partnership agreement with Japan aimed at reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade between the EU and Japan;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on an EU-Vietnam free trade agreement aimed at reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade between the EU and Vietnam.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Honourable Friend, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (James Duddridge) has made the following written Ministerial statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 19 November 2013 my predecessor, the Hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) updated the House on the start of an independent feasibility study on resettlement of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) by its former inhabitants. KPMG were appointed as independent consultants commissioned to carry out this study. Today KPMG will publish its draft final report in full. It is available via the Overseas Territories webpages of gov.uk. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with its Terms of Reference, the Feasibility Study has examined the full range of options for resettlement on each of the islands of the Territory, including Diego Garcia with its vital military base. Final views are now sought from the Chagossian community and all those with an interest. The study will conclude and issue its final report to Ministers in January 2015.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My hon Friend the Minister of State for Immigration and Security (James Brokenshire) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform the House that, subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary secondary legislation, I plan to implement important new provisions under Part 4 of the Immigration Act 2014 to tackle sham marriages and civil partnerships on Monday 2 March 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 4 of the Act will give us a much stronger platform for effective, systematic action to disrupt and deter sham marriages and civil partnerships and prevent them gaining an immigration advantage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will extend the marriage and civil partnership notice period from 15 days to 28 days for all couples in England and Wales marrying following civil preliminaries or forming a civil partnership.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples involving a non-European Economic Area (non-EEA) national who wish to marry in the Church of England or the Church in Wales will be required to complete civil preliminaries and give notice at a register office.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2 March 2015 I also plan to implement under Part 4 of the Act a new referral and investigation scheme for proposed marriages and civil partnerships across the UK involving a non-EEA national who could benefit in immigration terms. All proposed marriages and civil partnerships involving a non-EEA national with limited or no immigration status in the UK, or who does not provide specified evidence that they are exempt from the scheme, will be referred to the Home Office. Where we have reasonable grounds to suspect a sham, we will be able to extend the notice period in these referred cases to 70 days in order to
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;investigate and take appropriate enforcement or casework action where we establish a sham. A couple will be unable to get married or enter into a civil partnership on the basis of that notice if they do not comply with an investigation under the scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By extending the notice period and channelling to the Home Office all proposed marriages and civil partnerships which could bring an immigration benefit, the new system will give us much more time and information to identify and act against sham marriages and civil partnerships before they happen and, where they do go ahead, we will have the evidence we need on file to be able to refuse any subsequent immigration application in terms which will withstand appeal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The referral and investigation scheme will be extended to Scotland and to Northern Ireland from 2 March 2015, subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary secondary legislation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who give notice of marriage or civil partnership before 2 March 2015 will not be affected by the changes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitional arrangements will apply for couples where at least one party is resident overseas, who have made arrangements before 2 March 2015 for a marriage or civil partnership in England and Wales and who intend to give notice and get married or form a civil partnership in one visit on or after that date. Couples in this situation will be able to apply, at the time of giving their notice of marriage or civil partnership to the registration official, to have the notice period reduced to 15 days.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitional arrangements will also apply for couples involving a non-EEA national who before 2 March 2015 have been granted, or have applied for and are later granted, a common licence to marry in the Anglican Church in England and Wales. Couples in this situation will be able to marry on the basis of that licence and will not be required to complete civil preliminaries before marrying.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My hon Friend the Minister of State for Immigration and Security (James Brokenshire) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform the House that, subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary secondary legislation, I plan to implement important new provisions under Part 4 of the Immigration Act 2014 to tackle sham marriages and civil partnerships on Monday 2 March 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 4 of the Act will give us a much stronger platform for effective, systematic action to disrupt and deter sham marriages and civil partnerships and prevent them gaining an immigration advantage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will extend the marriage and civil partnership notice period from 15 days to 28 days for all couples in England and Wales marrying following civil preliminaries or forming a civil partnership.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples involving a non-European Economic Area (non-EEA) national who wish to marry in the Church of England or the Church in Wales will be required to complete civil preliminaries and give notice at a register office.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2 March 2015 I also plan to implement under Part 4 of the Act a new referral and investigation scheme for proposed marriages and civil partnerships across the UK involving a non-EEA national who could benefit in immigration terms. All proposed marriages and civil partnerships involving a non-EEA national with limited or no immigration status in the UK, or who does not provide specified evidence that they are exempt from the scheme, will be referred to the Home Office. Where we have reasonable grounds to suspect a sham, we will be able to extend the notice period in these referred cases to 70 days in order to
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;investigate and take appropriate enforcement or casework action where we establish a sham. A couple will be unable to get married or enter into a civil partnership on the basis of that notice if they do not comply with an investigation under the scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By extending the notice period and channelling to the Home Office all proposed marriages and civil partnerships which could bring an immigration benefit, the new system will give us much more time and information to identify and act against sham marriages and civil partnerships before they happen and, where they do go ahead, we will have the evidence we need on file to be able to refuse any subsequent immigration application in terms which will withstand appeal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The referral and investigation scheme will be extended to Scotland and to Northern Ireland from 2 March 2015, subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary secondary legislation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who give notice of marriage or civil partnership before 2 March 2015 will not be affected by the changes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitional arrangements will apply for couples where at least one party is resident overseas, who have made arrangements before 2 March 2015 for a marriage or civil partnership in England and Wales and who intend to give notice and get married or form a civil partnership in one visit on or after that date. Couples in this situation will be able to apply, at the time of giving their notice of marriage or civil partnership to the registration official, to have the notice period reduced to 15 days.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitional arrangements will also apply for couples involving a non-EEA national who before 2 March 2015 have been granted, or have applied for and are later granted, a common licence to marry in the Anglican Church in England and Wales. Couples in this situation will be able to marry on the basis of that licence and will not be required to complete civil preliminaries before marrying.

Support for witnesses at criminal courts across England and Wales is currently provided by Victim Support through a grant funded by the Ministry of Justice. This grant comes to an end on 31st March 2015 and the Ministry of Justice has undertaken a publicly
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;competed exercise for funding for the provision of the court-based Witness Service from 1st April 2015 for a period of two years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing that following this competition, the Ministry of Justice has awarded a two year grant totalling £24 million to Citizens Advice to provide the court-based Witness Service. Citizens Advice will take over the provision of this service from Victim Support with effect from April 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizens Advice will deliver a service that provides victims and witnesses with the support and information they need, and will work as a key partner with criminal justice stakeholders to ensure the service plays its part in helping put victims and witnesses at the heart of the criminal justice system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to record my appreciation to Victim Support for their work in supporting victims and witnesses, and in particular for providing support to witnesses at court over many years.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In November 2012 the Government announced the start of a new programme of work to drive down costs across prisons in order to deliver value for money for the taxpayer, accelerate cost reductions, maximise savings and to improve outcomes without compromising public safety. The programme included applying a new public sector staffing benchmark that had been developed by the Prison Service in competition with private
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sector bidders during Prison Competition Phase 2 and the competition of ancillary and through-the-gate resettlement services in public sector prisons.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allows HM Prison Service to focus on core custodial functions, with private and third sector partners adding their expertise and experience by delivering efficient and innovative ancillary and resettlement services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2013 we announced a competition for the management of a range of works, maintenance and facilities management services in public sector prisons. The competition was formally launched in January 2014, and included: maintenance; works and building projects; management of prison stores; waste disposal and collection; energy and environmental management; cleaning; and escorting of contractors and their vehicles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can today announce the outcome of the competition. After a rigorous evaluation of bids, Amey and Carillion have been selected to run the services across four geographical areas. These are:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lot 1 – Amey – North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humberside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lot 2 – Amey – East Midlands, West Midlands, Wales
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lot 3 – Carillion – East of England, London
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lot 4 – Carillion – South West, South Central, Kent and Sussex
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We intend to award five year contracts, with expected savings from these contracts in the region of £115m over that period. This represents an impressive saving for the taxpayer. We expect the new providers to start delivering these services on 1&lt;Sup&gt;st&lt;/Sup&gt; June
2015, following a period of mobilisation. Robust arrangements will be
in place to manage the new
contracts.”

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend The Minister for Pensions (Steve Webb MP) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that Mr Otto Thoresen has been appointed as the next Chair of NEST Corporation, the body that runs the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). Mr Thoresen will take up the appointment from 1 February 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEST was established as a low-cost, occupational pension scheme to support automatic enrolment. It is focussed on a target market of low to moderate earners and smaller employers who the market served inefficiently. Through delivery of its public service obligation, NEST ensures that all employers have a suitable pension arrangement through which to fulfil their automatic enrolment duties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEST already has around 1.6 million members and is working with over 9,000 employers. From June 2015, 1.2 million small employers - those with fewer than 50 workers - will start to engage with automatic enrolment. NEST will be critical in ensuring that these small employers are able to access low-cost pension provision for their workers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Thoresen brings with him a wealth of knowledge and experience of pensions to this challenging role and has a distinguished career of operating at the highest level in large and complex organisations. He is currently Director General of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and has held senior posts at Aegon, Abbey Life, Royal Life Holdings and Scottish Equitable. He is a Trustee of Young Enterprise; an adviser to the Citizens Advice Board Edinburgh; a Governor of the Pensions Policy Institute; and a Trustee of Step Change, a debt charity. His appointment as Chair demonstrates our commitment to recruiting people with a proven track record and the expertise to get the job done.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Iain Duncan Smith MP) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, we published Social Justice: transforming lives, a landmark document setting out a new vision for supporting the most disadvantaged families and individuals across the UK. The strategy outlined how family breakdown, low educational attainment, worklessness, problem debt, and addiction combine to cause the entrenched poverty affecting many of our communities, highlighting the complexity of the issues that many people face.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge, the strategy signalled that a new approach was needed – putting early intervention first, whilst tackling the root causes of poverty to give those experiencing disadvantage a meaningful second chance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I wish to inform the House that later today I am laying the Command Paper Social Justice: transforming lives – progress report, which shows what this Government has achieved in turning that vision into a reality, but also renews our commitment to this important agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last twelve months, we have continued the cultural change needed in order to achieve our aims, spanning not only families and individuals, but also public services and the way the Government funds them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As today’s progress report sets out, delivering this aim has required a complete shift in how the Government tackles social problems: an unrelenting focus on preventing problems arising in the first place; giving people the support they need to make transformational changes to their own lives when problems arise; and spearheading new multi-agency, outcome-focused approaches in order to address problems in the round.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The achievements set out in this report show how much can change in two years, and what this change means to individuals. We have made substantial progress against the commitments set out in the original Social Justice: transforming lives document, but we have not stopped there, and this report outlines what further action is required and how we should keep up the pressure on what we have created, which carries the profound theme of making meaningful life changes to the most vulnerable in our society.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By restating our commitment to transforming lives, and continuing to drive change in government, at a local level and across the voluntary sector, in how we help families and individuals in need, we will make Social Justice a reality for everyone in the United Kingdom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us continue to work together to build on this promising work. Our aim is not just about Social Justice in this Parliament; it is about Social Justice for years to come.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Minister for Europe (Mr David Lidington), has made the following written Ministerial statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has today laid a departmental Minute proposing a gift to Ukraine.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom is committed to supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Throughout the crisis that has unfolded during 2014, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has played a crucial role in monitoring events on the ground and facilitating dialogue between Ukrainian and separatist factions in the east of the country. The OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission has been operating in Ukraine since March 2014, and the UK has been a strong supporter of its role, providing nearly £2 million in funding and seconding a number of UK nationals into the Mission.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minsk Protocol, the peace plan and ceasefire agreed between Ukraine and Russia on 5 September has tasked the SMM with significant additional responsibilities, notably monitoring and verifying the ceasefire and monitoring the Ukraine-Russia border. The ceasefire is just about holding but with continued outbreaks of violence, and fatalities. It is therefore vital that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission receives the funding and equipment it needs to expand to its full capacity of 500 international monitors and be enabled to fulfil its mandate while operating within an often very challenging environment. As part of a package of enhanced support to the OSCE, the UK therefore intends to provide 10 armoured vehicles to the Mission, which have been identified as being crucial to allowing monitors to operate securely in the more volatile eastern parts of Ukraine.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This package will be funded by the Government’s Conflict Pool fund (FCO, MoD and DFID). It is in direct response to a request from Swiss Federal President and OSCE Chairman-in-Office Didier Burkhalter, who has written to OSCE Foreign Ministers requesting the provision of people, money and equipment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Departmental Minute sets out the proposal to gift 10 armoured vehicles and associated communications equipment worth £1,169,006 to the OSCE. The proposed gift will consist of the following UK sourced equipment:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. 10 Armoured Vehicles (8 x LC200, 2 x LC105): £1,120,000
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. 10 AV Spares kits: £11,266
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. 10 Motorola DM4601 VHF Radio plus ancillaries: £4,740
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. 10 Codan Envoy X1 HR Radio: £33,000
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed gift has been assessed against the consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. The proposed gift has been scrutinised and approved by a senior, cross-Whitehall Conflict Pool Approval Board, which has confirmed that it fits with the Government’s strategic and delivery objectives. Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials also assessed the project for human rights risks, using the Overseas Security and Justice Assistance guidelines established by the Foreign Secretary in 2011. They concluded that the risk of human rights violations arising from the project’s delivery could be successfully mitigated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury has approved the proposal in principle. If, during the period of fourteen parliamentary sitting days beginning on the date on which this Minute was laid before the House of Commons, a Member signifies an objection by giving notice of a Parliamentary Question or of a Motion relating to the Minute, or by otherwise raising the matter in the House, final approval of the gift will be withheld pending an examination of the objection.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Hon Friend the Secretary of State (Elizabeth Truss) has today made the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley), represented the UK at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 10 November in Brussels. Richard Lochhead MSP was also present.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisheries
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep Sea Fishing Opportunities 2015 and 2016
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Vella outlined his ambitions for setting fishing opportunity levels for deep sea stocks in 2015 and 2016. He stressed the need to manage stocks sustainably and to protect the long term interests of EU fishermen. Several Member States raised concerns with the Commission’s proposals and pressed for higher Total Allowable Catches (TACs). Lord De Mauley, along with Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, agreed with the Commission that deep sea ecosystems and fish stocks were particularly vulnerable and needed to be fished sustainably to ensure the future of deep sea fisheries. The Presidency and the Commission engaged in political negotiations over the course of the day and eventually tabled a compromise proposal, which Spain and Portugal voted against. The compromise proposal was, however, agreed by qualified majority voting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agriculture
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 Budget Amending Letter
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of Member States opposed the Commission’s proposals in its Amending Letter to the 2015 budget to fund the emergency measures in response to the Russian import ban from the CAP Crisis Reserve. These Member States also supported a common declaration tabled by France setting out their opposition. Lord De Mauley expressed sympathy with Member States who have been heavily impacted by the illegal and unjustified trade measures imposed by Russia. However, he made clear that the Commission’s proposal was part of much wider budget negotiations and that Finance Ministers would need to consider this within those discussions. Commissioner Hogan noted comments and stated that conciliation discussions were ongoing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus state aid
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission agreed to Cyprus’ request to remove a Council Decision under Article 108(2) TFEU, granting an exemption from state aid rules to waive all tax on motor fuel used for agriculture, from the Council agenda until December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any other business
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic Regulation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord De Mauley, along with a number of other Ministers, broadly supported the common declaration of the V4+3 countries (CZ, PL, HU, SK, BG, RO, SI) which calls on the Commission to ensure its proposal for a new Organic Regulation promotes growth of the sector. The Netherlands, Austria and Germany questioned whether the Commission should withdraw its proposal and start again given the extent of Member States’ concerns. Commissioner Hogan said that he was willing to consider changes to the proposals and hoped that an agreement could be reached in 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peaches and nectarines
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Hogan rejected a Greek request for additional support measures for Greek peach and nectarine producers arguing that prices in Greece were above the EU average. He also urged Greece to consider structural problems in the sector as it had suffered three crises in the last six years and these would reoccur if problems of oversupply were not addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young farmers
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency presented a short paper on ideas to strengthen EU policies for young farmers. Several Member States were interested in the idea of working with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to increase young farmers’ access to credit. While underlining the range of existing measures available to support young farmers, Commissioner Hogan confirmed that he had established a working group between the EIB and his Commission services to explore ideas in this area.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICAAN internet domain names
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France and Spain urged the Commission to prevent the sale of generic internet domain names such as .wine or .vin as it risked undermining the protection of EU producers, particularly those with registered Geographical Indications. Commissioner Hogan stressed that he was keeping this under close review.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of honey bees
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slovenia called for a new legal framework on residue levels for substances in bee feed composition. Commissioner Andriukaitis stressed that he would do all he could to protect bee health but believed Member States and bee keepers were often better placed to help.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Corn Rootworm
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria, Hungary and Romania called for EU-wide measures to prevent the spread of the damaging Western Corn Rootworm. Lord De Mauley supported their request and underlined the need to review the pesticides regulation. Commissioner Andriukaitis offered to examine the situation and acknowledged that a harmonised pesticide approval system would improve the availability of pesticides.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;409,221 payments to individual investors have been issued totalling £555.2 million.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;37,732 initial payments to With-Profits Annuitants (WPAs) or their estates have been issued by the Scheme, totalling £82 million. Subsequent annual payments totalling £187.5 million have also been issued to annuitants.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;440,108 payments totalling £165.8 million have been issued to those who bought their policy through their company pension scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now approximately 151,000 policyholders who are due a payment but where the Scheme has not yet been able to trace or validate their address.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scheme has gone to significant lengths to trace eligible policyholders. It remains committed to tracing and paying as many eligible policyholders as possible, and will continue to consider all proportionate actions it can take to do this, including working with the Department for Work and Pensions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scheme encourages any policyholders who believe themselves to be eligible to call the Scheme on: 0300 0200 150. The Scheme can verify the identity of most policyholders on the telephone, which means any payment due can usually be received within two weeks.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My rt hon Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Theresa May) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The informal G6 group of Ministers of the Interior from the six largest European Union countries held its most recent meeting in Paris on 6 November 2014. Representatives of the United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the European Commission attended for part of the meeting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit was chaired by the French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and I represented the United Kingdom. The other participating States were represented by Jorge Fernández Diaz (Spain), Teresa Piotrowska (Poland), Angelino Alfano (Italy), and Thomas de Maizière (Germany). The USA was represented by Alejandro Mayorkas (Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security) and Eric Holder (US Attorney General). The European Commission was represented by Dimitris Avramopoulos (Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship) and the European Union by Gilles de Kerchove (EU Counter Terrorism Coordinator). In addition to the usual attendees Efkan Ala (Turkey) and Steven Blaney (Canada) were present.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first session of the day was on priority issues for the next European Parliament. The discussion touched on border checks and the importance of
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;balancing security and liberty but focused mainly on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Directive. Delegates agreed on the importance of making quick progress to conclude the PNR Directive.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lunchtime discussion was on migration flows. The group collectively agreed the importance of implementing the JHA Council conclusions of 10 October covering action in cooperation with third countries; reinforced management of external borders and Frontex; and action at Member States" level - reception and fingerprinting. The European Commissioner (Avramopoulos) said the implementation of the conclusions would be a priority for the Commission. Conversation in this session also touched on the importance of securing borders and the need for fingerprinting asylum seekers at their point of entry to the EU.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first session after lunch was titled ‘Radicalisation via the Internet’. Delegates noted the positive progress that had been made following discussions with Internet Service Providers (ISP) and agreed the need for joint working.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final session of the day was on the issue of foreign fighters. A number of countries reported developments and M. Cazeneuve (France) noted their new legislation which enables them to ban people from leaving the country if they thought they were involved in terrorism by way of withdrawal of their passport and ID card. He concluded by suggesting that all countries would benefit from a power to revoke passports and that it was vital that information sharing be improved. He noted that there must be progress on PNR and border checks and strengthening of co-operation with Turkey.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my interventions, I supported the need for an EU PNR Directive which included PNR on intra-EU journeys, supported the JHA Council conclusions of 10 October on future migration policies and set out the action which the UK has taken to tackle the problem of returning foreign fighters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was announced at the meeting that the next G6 will take place in Dresden in Germany on the 1st and 2nd June 2015.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Schools (Mr. David Laws) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I wish to inform the House of the publication of the Government’s response to the second annual report by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission is an independent body which monitors the progress of the Government and others in improving social mobility and reducing child poverty in the United Kingdom. The Commission plays a vital role in ensuring the Government makes progress in both of these areas and we are grateful to it for its thorough and comprehensive report.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are committed to ending child poverty. As set out in the Child Poverty Strategy 2014-17 published earlier this year, we are taking action to improve the life chances of children by: raising the incomes of poor children’s families by helping them get into work and making work pay; supporting the living standards of low-income families; and raising educational outcomes of poor children. This approach reflects the reality of child poverty in the UK today and is the only way to achieve lasting change to protect the poorest in society.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fairness is a fundamental value of this Government, and improving social mobility continues to be a primary goal of our social policy. We are determined to break down the barriers to social mobility at all stages of a person’s life, from when they are born right through into adulthood, to ensure that everyone can fulfil their potential.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the Government’s response will be available later today at www.gov.uk/dfe.

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Hon Friend the Secretary of State (Elizabeth Truss) has today made the following stateme</str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Hon Friend the Secretary of State (Elizabeth Truss) has today made the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement updates the House on Government action to prepare for potential flooding this winter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting the country from flooding is a core Defra priority. This Government is investing £3.2 billion in flood defences in this Parliament, compared to £2.7 billion in the previous five years. This represents a real terms increase and is helping us better protect over 165,000 properties since 2010. In addition, for the first time we have committed to 6 years of future capital spending to protect a further 300,000 properties and provide long term planning for flood resilience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter 2013/14
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter saw the wettest weather on record. There were record river flows, sea levels, wave heights and groundwater levels across widespread areas of the country. Although flood defences protected 1.4 million homes, 8,342 homes were flooded and thousands of people were affected by disruption to businesses, infrastructure, transport and utilities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then the Government has led a major flood recovery effort, including committing more than £560 million in recovery support funding. The result is that going into this winter every community is at least as well or better protected than it was last winter. In England, 844 flood defences owned by the Environment Agency, local authorities and others were damaged over the winter. All of the flood defences damaged last winter have been repaired, with either permanent or temporary repairs. Defra made an extra £270 million available to repair these defences. Permanent defences have been restored to over 200,000 properties. The Government has committed more than £20 million to help Somerset, which was particularly hard hit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somerset
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Somerset, the dredging of the Rivers Tone and Parrett was completed on time and on budget at the end of October. Somerset has been awarded a further £13.1 million through the Local Growth Fund for more dredging; developing options for a Bridgwater Barrier; and a project to increase capacity of the River Sowy. Work is under way to raise key roads at Beer Wall and Muchelney. The Government is working with Somerset County Council and others to establish a new rivers authority that will give local people the power to manage their flood risk.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military assistance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter highlighted the valuable contribution our Armed Forces can make. The Government has simplified the process by which local responders can request military help in emergencies, and local authorities were informed of the new arrangements in October.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving resilience
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is also taking action to improve the resilience of our transport, energy and water supply networks. For example, a review into resilience of transport networks was published in July and my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin) will today publish the Government’s response.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defra has also been working with water companies as they review their emergency plans to ensure water supplies are not affected by flooding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with communities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally, we are improving the way we work with communities to give them clarity on what works are being undertaken and the outcomes they will deliver. The Environment Agency has held local meetings across the country to explain its current maintenance programme, giving people the opportunity to contribute to and influence these programmes. We are also removing barriers for individuals and local groups to undertake work such as dredging watercourses through the River Maintenance Pilots scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with local authorities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working with local authorities to plan for flood risk through the development of local flood risk management strategies. We have identified those authorities where we feel work is most urgent, and we are strongly encouraging them to get strategies in place as soon as possible. We have also started work
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;on a review of the 2010 Flood and Water Management Act, to check that flood risk is being properly managed at a local level.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National level preparedness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have improved our ability to respond to emergencies at a national level. For example, we will hold precautionary COBR meetings if significant flooding is likely in advance of public holidays. This will help us ensure all organisations are fully prepared and ready to respond. The arrangements for making use of temporary flood defences and pumps have also been improved. On the recovery effort, my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Communities (Eric Pickles) is updating the House today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood insurance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are taking action to ensure people at risk of flooding can protect themselves by securing affordable home insurance. The new Flood Re scheme will limit the amount that people pay for floods cover when it is introduced next year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, we launched the national “Get Ready for Winter” campaign with the Met Office to encourage people and communities to think about preparing for winter. This month is the Environment Agency’s “flood awareness month”, and it has been explaining how to prepare and encouraging more people to join the 1 million who are already signed up to the flood warning service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing this Parliament (2010/11-2014/15) to the previous five years, investment in flood risk management has increased in real terms by 5%. Over the coming six year period, we will be making record levels of investment (£2.3 billion) in capital flood defence projects. This will begin with £370 million in 2015/16 and then the same in real terms each year, rising to over £400 million in 2020/21. This is the first time that such a long term settlement has been set out demonstrating our commitment to managing flood risk and providing communities with increased security.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment will deliver long-term value for money and reduce the risk of flooding to a further 300,000 households between April 2015 and March 2021, on top of the 165,000 protected during the current spending period. By the end of the decade, we will have provided a better level of protection to at least 465,000 households.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the exceptional weather conditions experienced last winter, in the large majority of cases our defences stood up well. They protected around 1.4 million properties and more than 600,000 acres of farmland from flooding. This underlines the importance of continuing our investment in flood defences. We have one of the best forecasting and warning systems in the world. We are determined to reduce the risk further and provide better protection for people’s homes, farms and businesses across the country. We have acted on the lessons from last winter and together with our local partners we are better prepared than ever before.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Hon Friend the Secretary of State (Elizabeth Truss) has today made the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement updates the House on Government action to prepare for potential flooding this winter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting the country from flooding is a core Defra priority. This Government is investing £3.2 billion in flood defences in this Parliament, compared to £2.7 billion in the previous five years. This represents a real terms increase and is helping us better protect over 165,000 properties since 2010. In addition, for the first time we have committed to 6 years of future capital spending to protect a further 300,000 properties and provide long term planning for flood resilience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter 2013/14
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter saw the wettest weather on record. There were record river flows, sea levels, wave heights and groundwater levels across widespread areas of the country. Although flood defences protected 1.4 million homes, 8,342 homes were flooded and thousands of people were affected by disruption to businesses, infrastructure, transport and utilities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then the Government has led a major flood recovery effort, including committing more than £560 million in recovery support funding. The result is that going into this winter every community is at least as well or better protected than it was last winter. In England, 844 flood defences owned by the Environment Agency, local authorities and others were damaged over the winter. All of the flood defences damaged last winter have been repaired, with either permanent or temporary repairs. Defra made an extra £270 million available to repair these defences. Permanent defences have been restored to over 200,000 properties. The Government has committed more than £20 million to help Somerset, which was particularly hard hit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somerset
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Somerset, the dredging of the Rivers Tone and Parrett was completed on time and on budget at the end of October. Somerset has been awarded a further £13.1 million through the Local Growth Fund for more dredging; developing options for a Bridgwater Barrier; and a project to increase capacity of the River Sowy. Work is under way to raise key roads at Beer Wall and Muchelney. The Government is working with Somerset County Council and others to establish a new rivers authority that will give local people the power to manage their flood risk.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military assistance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter highlighted the valuable contribution our Armed Forces can make. The Government has simplified the process by which local responders can request military help in emergencies, and local authorities were informed of the new arrangements in October.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving resilience
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is also taking action to improve the resilience of our transport, energy and water supply networks. For example, a review into resilience of transport networks was published in July and my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin) will today publish the Government’s response.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defra has also been working with water companies as they review their emergency plans to ensure water supplies are not affected by flooding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with communities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally, we are improving the way we work with communities to give them clarity on what works are being undertaken and the outcomes they will deliver. The Environment Agency has held local meetings across the country to explain its current maintenance programme, giving people the opportunity to contribute to and influence these programmes. We are also removing barriers for individuals and local groups to undertake work such as dredging watercourses through the River Maintenance Pilots scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with local authorities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working with local authorities to plan for flood risk through the development of local flood risk management strategies. We have identified those authorities where we feel work is most urgent, and we are strongly encouraging them to get strategies in place as soon as possible. We have also started work
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;on a review of the 2010 Flood and Water Management Act, to check that flood risk is being properly managed at a local level.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National level preparedness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have improved our ability to respond to emergencies at a national level. For example, we will hold precautionary COBR meetings if significant flooding is likely in advance of public holidays. This will help us ensure all organisations are fully prepared and ready to respond. The arrangements for making use of temporary flood defences and pumps have also been improved. On the recovery effort, my Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Communities (Eric Pickles) is updating the House today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood insurance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are taking action to ensure people at risk of flooding can protect themselves by securing affordable home insurance. The new Flood Re scheme will limit the amount that people pay for floods cover when it is introduced next year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, we launched the national “Get Ready for Winter” campaign with the Met Office to encourage people and communities to think about preparing for winter. This month is the Environment Agency’s “flood awareness month”, and it has been explaining how to prepare and encouraging more people to join the 1 million who are already signed up to the flood warning service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing this Parliament (2010/11-2014/15) to the previous five years, investment in flood risk management has increased in real terms by 5%. Over the coming six year period, we will be making record levels of investment (£2.3 billion) in capital flood defence projects. This will begin with £370 million in 2015/16 and then the same in real terms each year, rising to over £400 million in 2020/21. This is the first time that such a long term settlement has been set out demonstrating our commitment to managing flood risk and providing communities with increased security.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment will deliver long-term value for money and reduce the risk of flooding to a further 300,000 households between April 2015 and March 2021, on top of the 165,000 protected during the current spending period. By the end of the decade, we will have provided a better level of protection to at least 465,000 households.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the exceptional weather conditions experienced last winter, in the large majority of cases our defences stood up well. They protected around 1.4 million properties and more than 600,000 acres of farmland from flooding. This underlines the importance of continuing our investment in flood defences. We have one of the best forecasting and warning systems in the world. We are determined to reduce the risk further and provide better protection for people’s homes, farms and businesses across the country. We have acted on the lessons from last winter and together with our local partners we are better prepared than ever before.

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Rt Hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made the following statement to the House of Commons:&lt;/p</str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Rt Hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made the following statement to the House of Commons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have today deposited in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of a Direction I have given to the Intelligence Services Commissioner, the Right Honourable Sir Mark Waller, under section 59A of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This Direction puts on a statutory footing the Commissioner’s role overseeing compliance with the Consolidated Guidance to Intelligence Officers and Service Personnel on the Detention and Interviewing of Detainees Overseas, and on the Passing and Receipt of Intelligence Relating to Detainees.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner’s oversight of the Consolidated Guidance began when it was published for the first time by this Government on 6 July 2010. His Annual Reports since then, which are published and available on the Commissioner’s website, detail his work overseeing compliance with those aspects of the Guidance for which he has responsibility. In his 2013 Annual Report he asked me to issue this Direction and put his work in this regard on a statutory footing. I said I would issue this Direction in my statement to the House on 25 November 2014, following the publication of the Intelligence and Security Committee’s report into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their Report, the Intelligence and Security Committee were critical of the Secret Intelligence Service for the handling of allegations of Michael Adebolajo’s mistreatment in Kenya, made during his interview by the police under the Terrorism Act 2000 on his return to the UK. I have therefore asked Sir Mark to examine the concerns raised by the Committee on the Government’s responsibilities in relation to partner counter-terrorism units overseas. He will have full access to all the material referred to in the Committee’s report.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intelligence Services Commissioner plays a crucial role as part of the oversight regime for the work of the Security and Intelligence Agencies. His 2013 Annual Report, published on 26 June 2014, sets out in detail his work over the past year. I am grateful to Sir Mark Waller for his continuing scrutiny of the Agencies and their activities, including compliance with the Consolidated Guidance. This Government has been determined from the outset to have greater clarity about what is and what is not acceptable when dealing with detainees held overseas by other countries. That is why we published the Guidance at the earliest opportunity. It makes clear that our Services must never take any action where they know or believe that
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;torture will occur, that if they become aware of abuse they should report it to the Government so we can try to stop it and if there is a risk of serious mistreatment, it is for Ministers—rightly—to determine what action, if any, should be taken.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am today publishing the Government response to the ‘Transforming Legal Aid: Crime Duty Contracts’ consultation published on 24 September. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation was specifically about the reports produced by KPMG LLP and Otterburn Legal Consulting regarding the legal aid litigator market, which helped inform decisions on the number of criminal legal aid duty contracts to be offered across England and Wales in 2015. We have thoroughly reviewed all the responses received.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Legal Aid Agency will let 527 crime duty contracts. This has been revised from 525. The LAA is also today issuing an Invitation to Tender for those organisations eligible to apply for a 2015 Duty Provider Crime Contract. Contracts have already been awarded for own client work, the other type of criminal legal aid contract we announced in February.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide further help to firms in rural areas, we have decided to introduce payments for travelling times in excess of 90 minutes. We will also relax the office requirements in the split procurement areas and London to give greater flexibility. This builds on the support measures introduced earlier, such as introducing interim payments for lawyers involved in lengthy Crown Court cases and establishing a business partnering network to help practitioners with organisational and financial advice, if they need it. We have also worked with the British Business Bank to develop guidance and advice specifically for the legal aid market.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have previously informed the House that a second fee reduction for litigators is forecast for mid 2015. The Legal Aid Agency are inviting bidders to bid on the basis that the fee reduction will take place in July, subject to the further considerations we have already said we will undertake.”

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin), has made the following Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the 2013-14 winter of sustained wet and windy weather, I invited Richard Brown OBE to chair a review of the resilience of our transport networks to extreme weather events. The Review was published in July and today I am publishing the Government’s Response.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Brown’s Review examined the resilience of our major transport modes, assessed lessons learned and put forward more than 60 recommendations to improve resilience both in the short term and long term. The majority of recommendations quite rightly addressed the impacts of last winter’s weather which resulted in flooding, damage to transport assets and disruption to passenger services. The review did not look at the impacts of snow and ice as these were covered in the Quarmby review of 2010.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We accept the recommendations made in the Review, and the Response published today sets out in detail the actions being taken forward by Government and transport owners and operators to improve the resilience of our transport infrastructure and its operations. Good progress has been made since the Review’s publication. Wherever possible actions have been put in place in advance of this winter, whilst other resilience activities have been planned for delivery as soon as practicable. Areas covered include asset management; communications; economics and funding; flooding;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;geotechnics; maintenance; supporting infrastructure; user behaviour; vegetation management and weather forecasting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst there will always be vulnerabilities to our transport networks from extreme weather, the review has served to join up a lot of the existing work on resilience across transport modes and has prompted transport operators to take immediate action which should put them in an enhanced state of readiness to respond and recover from future severe weather events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Department will monitor the progress of the resilience activities set out in the Government response, and will provide a supplementary report next year to provide an update on the delivery of the actions highlighted in the response.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the Government Response can be found in the Libraries of both Houses and will be available at https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/review-of-the-resilience-of-the-transport-network-to-extreme-weather-events-expert-panel.

This is the fifth and final annual independent review, as required by the Welfare Reform Act 2007.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Litchfield has reported on the evolution of the Work Capability Assessment since 2008, as well as progress made in implementing recommendations made in the previous Independent Reviews. He has explored how these changes have had an impact on the operation of the Work Capability Assessment and the way in which it is perceived. He has recommended further minor changes to the assessment and recognised the need for a period of stability for the current WCA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Work Capability Assessment is integral to the Government’s commitment to ensuring that as many people as are able to do so engage in employment and those who genuinely cannot work receive the appropriate support.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcomes Dr Litchfield’s report as a key step in making sure the assessment is as effective as possible and will carefully consider his report and recommendations. The Government’s response to Dr Litchfield’s report will be published during this Parliament.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is investing in over 100 new road schemes over this parliament and next, 84 of which are brand new today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This major reform will add over 1,300 extra lane miles on motorways and trunk roads and fix some of the most notorious and longstanding problem areas on the strategic road network. These plans are published today in the first ever Road Investment Strategy, which has been developed to keep the population connected and the economy growing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the Road Investment Strategy documents have been made available in the Libraries of both Houses and can be found on the Department’s website at: www.gov.uk/dft.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is investing in over 100 new road schemes over this parliament and next, 84 of which are brand new today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This major reform will add over 1,300 extra lane miles on motorways and trunk roads and fix some of the most notorious and longstanding problem areas on the strategic road network. These plans are published today in the first ever Road Investment Strategy, which has been developed to keep the population connected and the economy growing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the Road Investment Strategy documents have been made available in the Libraries of both Houses and can be found on the Department’s website at: www.gov.uk/dft.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education (Ms. Nicky Morgan) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 30 September 2014, I launched a statutory one-month consultation seeking representations on the draft legislative Order – the Education (National Curriculum) (Attainment Targets and Programmes of Study) (England) (No. 3) Order 2014 and associated
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;regulations – required to bring the new national curriculum programme of study for science at key stage 4 into effect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing the final programme of study which is set out in the revised national curriculum framework document. The new programme of study will be taught in schools alongside the new science GCSEs from September 2016. It is important to consider the new programme of study in tandem with the GCSE subject content, published in April 2014, and to ensure that the curriculum and qualifications are fully coherent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme of study in science at key stage 4 sets expectations that match those in the highest performing jurisdictions, and the content is closely aligned to GCSE combined science content. It focuses on the big ideas in science such as evolution and inheritance, the atomic structure and energy and forces and includes new content on developing areas such as the human genome. The working scientifically section emphasises the importance of practical work including experimental skills, analysis and evaluation of data and the understanding and nature of scientific evidence. It makes clear that working scientifically should be embedded within the subject content across all three science disciplines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publication of the key stage 4 science programme of study completes the review of the national curriculum. We have achieved our aim of ensuring that the new national curriculum provides a rigorous basis for teaching, and a benchmark for all schools to improve their performance. It represents a clear step forward for schools, ensuring that all children have the opportunity to acquire a core of essential knowledge in key subjects. The majority of the new national curriculum came into force from September 2014. The new national curriculum for English, mathematics and science for years 2 and 6 will come into force from September 2015; the new curriculum for English and mathematics for key stage 4 will be phased in from September 2015 and that for key stage 4 science from September 2016, alongside first teaching of the new GCSEs for these subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the revised national curriculum framework document has been placed in the Library of the House.

The new national curriculum for English, mathematics and science for years 2 and 6 will come into force from September 2015; the new curriculum for English and mathematics for key stage 4 will be phased in from September 2015 and that for key stage 4 science from September 2016, alongside first teaching of the new GCSEs for these subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the revised national curriculum framework document has been placed in the Library of the House.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Statement included the following attachment: The national curriculum in England - December 14 (Master_final_national_curriculum.pdf)

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My honourable friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (David Gauke) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Government is committed to delivering a tax system that is fair and promotes growth and competitiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the Autumn Statement 2014, the Government has announced a number of measures to reform stamp duty land tax, help tackle tax avoidance, address unfair tax outcomes and support investment. The legislation for these measures will have immediate effect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamp duty land tax: reform of structure, rates and bands
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is introducing legislation which reforms stamp duty land tax on purchases of residential property with effect on and after 4 December so that it will be payable at each rate on the portion of the purchase price which falls within each band, rather than at a single rate on the whole transaction value. The legislation also amends the rates and thresholds to ensure this change is introduced in a fair way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporation tax: restricting relief for internally-generated goodwill transfers between related parties on incorporation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is introducing legislation to restrict a company’s corporation tax relief where internally-generated goodwill and customer related intangible assets are acquired on the incorporation of a related party’s business. The change will be effective for all acquisitions occurring on or after 3 December 2014 to prevent forestalling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital gains tax: restricting entrepreneurs’ relief for goodwill on incorporation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is introducing legislation to prevent claims for entrepreneurs’ relief on disposals of the reputation and customer relationships associated with a business (the ‘goodwill’), to a close company to which the seller is related. The change will be effective for disposals of goodwill on or after 3 December 2014 to prevent forestalling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital gains tax: entrepreneurs’ relief and deferred gains
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With effect from 3 December, the Government will allow gains which are eligible for the 10 per cent capital gains tax rate provided by entrepreneurs’ relief (ER), but which are instead deferred into investments which qualify for the enterprise investment scheme, or into investments eligible for social investment tax relief, to remain eligible for ER when the gain is realised. Draft legislation for this measure will be published on 10 December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income tax: miscellaneous loss relief
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is introducing legislation to counter avoidance of income tax involving losses from miscellaneous transactions. Legislation denying loss relief where a miscellaneous loss, or miscellaneous income, arises from relevant tax avoidance arrangements will have effect from 3 December 2014. Legislation will also be introduced with effect from tax year 2015-16 to limit relief to miscellaneous income of the same type as the loss.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank loss-relief restriction
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will introduce legislation in Finance Bill 2015 to restrict the use of brought forward losses by banks. The legislation will have effect from 1 April 2015, except for anti-avoidance rules that come into effect from 3 December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pressure, high temperature cluster area allowance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is introducing legislation to create a new cluster area allowance to support the development of high pressure, high temperature projects and encourage exploration and appraisal activity in the surrounding area or ‘cluster’. The allowance will exempt a portion of a company’s profits from the supplementary charge. The amount of profit exempt will equal 62.5 per cent of the qualifying capital expenditure a company incurs in relation to a cluster area on or after 3 December 2014.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inheritance tax exemption for medals and other awards
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is extending the existing inheritance tax exemption for medals and other decorations that are awarded for valour or gallantry. From 3 December 2014, it will apply to all decorations and medals awarded to the armed services or emergency services personnel, and to awards made by the Crown for achievements and service in public life. Draft legislation for this measure will be published on 10 December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate debt
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is introducing legislation to repeal rules concerning the tax treatment of deferred interest and discounts on debt issued to UK companies by a connected company in a non-qualifying territory. The repeal will have effect for loans entered into on or after 3 December 2014; for loans already existing at that date it will be effective in respect of interest accruing after 31 December 2015. If the creditor or the terms of an existing loan are changed between 3 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the repeal will have effect for that loan in respect of interest accruing after the change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details on the measures listed above can be found on the gov.uk website.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Mr Mark Francois) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new call-out order has been made under section 56(1B) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to enable Reservists to continue to be called into permanent service in support of the United Kingdom’s contribution to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 100 Reservists have been called out for UN operations in Cyprus over the last 12 months. Over the period this new order will be in force we anticipate calling out similar numbers, who will be fully integrated with their Regular colleagues. The use of Reserves in Cyprus is now considered routine business and is fully in line with our policy of having more capable, usable, integrated and relevant Reserve Forces.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, we plan on calling out only willing and available Reservists who have the support of their employer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order takes effect from 11 December 2014 and ceases to have effect on 10 December 2015.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Mr Mark Francois) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new call-out order has been made under section 56(1B) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to enable Reservists to continue to be called into permanent service in support of the United Kingdom’s contribution to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 100 Reservists have been called out for UN operations in Cyprus over the last 12 months. Over the period this new order will be in force we anticipate calling out similar numbers, who will be fully integrated with their Regular colleagues. The use of Reserves in Cyprus is now considered routine business and is fully in line with our policy of having more capable, usable, integrated and relevant Reserve Forces.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, we plan on calling out only willing and available Reservists who have the support of their employer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order takes effect from 11 December 2014 and ceases to have effect on 10 December 2015.

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr Iain Duncan Smith MP)</str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr Iain Duncan Smith MP) has made the following Written Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government has made significant progress in putting the welfare state on a sustainable footing – undertaking major reforms to benefits and pensions, in order to restore fairness and restore public finances at the same time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this decisive action, at Budget 2014, the Government took the unprecedented step of introducing a Cap on welfare. Today, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has confirmed that the Government is on track to meet the Welfare Cap commitment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the OBR now forecasts welfare spending outside the Cap to be £2.3 billion a year lower on average over the next 4 years, compared to Budget 2014 –
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;contributing to a reduction in the overall welfare spending forecast in each and every year of the Cap forecast.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a marked improvement in exercising discipline over welfare spending. Spending in scope of the Welfare Cap accounts for £1 in every £6 spent by the Government. Yet in spite of this, it had never previously been subject to firm controls and was allowed to increase by £48 billion under the last Government, up from £70 billion to £118 billion. This was within an overall welfare bill that increased by 60% in real terms, rising even before the recession.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Government’s welfare reforms are set to save nearly £50 billion over this Parliament. But for these vital changes, welfare spending was set to be that much higher still.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, by actively managing welfare spending, we have halted the damaging trend of welfare spending escalating out of control. Overall welfare spending has been falling as a proportion of GDP since 2012, and last year fell in real terms for the first time in 16 years – even whilst spending on pensioners rose. This year, working age welfare spending is forecast to be £3 billion lower in real terms than in 2009/10. Testament to the success of the Government’s long-term economic plan, there have been significant falls in spending on unemployment, down over £2 billion since the recession; and on out-of work benefits, back to pre-recession levels by 2015/16.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the OBR’s first assessment of the Welfare Cap shows that the Government is forecast to meet the Welfare Cap commitment, in each of the 4 years of the forecast period from 2015/16 to 2018/19. The Government is living within the rules of the Cap and there has been no breach.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detail of that assessment is set out in full in the OBR’s Economic and Fiscal Outlook December 2014. This explains that the use of the margin in 2015/16 and 2016/17 is due to forecast reasons, not policy changes – the margin exists to allow for such fluctuations in the forecast. As the OBR has set out in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook, its forecast for the volume of Work Capability Assessments for Employment and Support Allowance has been adjusted downward, and the forecast of the number of people who are likely to receive PIP has been adjusted upward. These, alongside other changes to the incapacity and disability benefit forecasts, have increased the forecast and result in use of the margin in 2015/16 and 2016/17, then falling below the margin in 2017/18 and 2018/19. However, overall, compared to its forecasts at Budget 2014, the OBR has revised welfare spending down by £1.3 billion a year on average up to 2018/19.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these reforms are set to save money and deliver efficiencies in the long-term. That much is shown by excess spending continually falling over the 4-year period, bringing spending below the level of the Welfare Cap in 2017/18 and 2018/19.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, this reflects the full effect of the Government’s action to bring spending back under control, arresting the growth that was once left to escalate. In future years, the aim must be to continue to exercise discipline and rigour in managing welfare spending – as this Government has committed to do.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Hon friend, the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries (Ed Vaizey) has made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Telecommunications Council will take place in Brussels on 27th November 2014. The Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, Shan Morgan, will represent the UK at this Council, and below are the agenda items and the positions, the UK intends to adopt on each of them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first item is a progress report from the Presidency on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accessibility to public sector bodies" web-sites (First reading - EM16006/11). Whilst no formal debate is scheduled on the agenda it is expected that some Member States may wish to intervene. In this instance the UK’s intervention will strongly support the Presidency’s progress report.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second item is a report on state of play on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down measures concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a Connected Continent. (First reading - EM13562/13 and 13555/13 + ADDs 1-2).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I intend to indicate UK’s continued support for a simplified Regulation and in particular an outcome that leads to the cessation of mobile roaming charges by 2016, along with increased consumer protection. I will also signal our support for a principles-based and outcome focussed net-neutrality regulation. Finally, we will reiterate our stance, whereby we do not support an outcome that would give the Commission further competency over spectrum management.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These items will be followed by a debate on the mid-term review of the Commissions EU 2020 strategy – EU2020 –Preparation of mid-term review. (EU 2020 is the 10-year strategy proposed by the European Commission on 3 March 2010 for advancement of the economy of the European Union. It aimed to produce “smart, sustainable, inclusive growth” with greater coordination of national and European policy). The questions in the main focus on the way forward for the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), which is one of the 7 flagship initiatives under the EU2020 strategy. The UK’s intervention will include: the UK welcomes the Commission’s decision to prioritise actions to boost the digital economy; and the UK believes the Commission’s plan should focus on five aspects of the digital economy as a coherent package: e commerce, data, competition and protection, copyright and telecommunications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then follow discussion on draft council conclusions on internet governance. We are expecting these conclusions to be discussed in detail and it is not clear whether or not they will be agreed. The current text goes into a great number of detailed policy questions
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and consequently there are a number of unresolved differences of view. The UK has argued that the conclusions should not undermine the role of key organisations in the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance, should not seek to enlarge the role of governments in that model and should not call on European Member States to speak with one voice on these issues. Unless these issues are adequately resolved, the UK will not be able to accept council conclusions. Other Member States may also block consensus, if their own detailed concerns are not addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by two items under AOB, the first being information from the Presidency on a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high level of network and information security across the Union. (First reading – EM6342/13). We do not intend to intervene on either of these items.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, under AOB, the Latvian delegation will inform the Council of their priorities for their forthcoming Presidency before Council adjourns until the next meeting in Summer 2015.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Hon friend, the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries (Ed Vaizey) has made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Telecommunications Council will take place in Brussels on 27th November 2014. The Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, Shan Morgan, will represent the UK at this Council, and below are the agenda items and the positions, the UK intends to adopt on each of them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first item is a progress report from the Presidency on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accessibility to public sector bodies" web-sites (First reading - EM16006/11). Whilst no formal debate is scheduled on the agenda it is expected that some Member States may wish to intervene. In this instance the UK’s intervention will strongly support the Presidency’s progress report.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second item is a report on state of play on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down measures concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a Connected Continent. (First reading - EM13562/13 and 13555/13 + ADDs 1-2).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I intend to indicate UK’s continued support for a simplified Regulation and in particular an outcome that leads to the cessation of mobile roaming charges by 2016, along with increased consumer protection. I will also signal our support for a principles-based and outcome focussed net-neutrality regulation. Finally, we will reiterate our stance, whereby we do not support an outcome that would give the Commission further competency over spectrum management.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These items will be followed by a debate on the mid-term review of the Commissions EU 2020 strategy – EU2020 –Preparation of mid-term review. (EU 2020 is the 10-year strategy proposed by the European Commission on 3 March 2010 for advancement of the economy of the European Union. It aimed to produce “smart, sustainable, inclusive growth” with greater coordination of national and European policy). The questions in the main focus on the way forward for the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), which is one of the 7 flagship initiatives under the EU2020 strategy. The UK’s intervention will include: the UK welcomes the Commission’s decision to prioritise actions to boost the digital economy; and the UK believes the Commission’s plan should focus on five aspects of the digital economy as a coherent package: e commerce, data, competition and protection, copyright and telecommunications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then follow discussion on draft council conclusions on internet governance. We are expecting these conclusions to be discussed in detail and it is not clear whether or not they will be agreed. The current text goes into a great number of detailed policy questions
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and consequently there are a number of unresolved differences of view. The UK has argued that the conclusions should not undermine the role of key organisations in the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance, should not seek to enlarge the role of governments in that model and should not call on European Member States to speak with one voice on these issues.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Hon friend, the Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy (Ed Vaizey) has made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Telecommunications Council took place in Brussels on 27th November 2014. The Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, Shan Morgan represented the UK. It is worth noting that the agenda was taken in a different order as reported in the Pre-Council Statement and this is reflected in this statement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first item was a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accessibility to public sector bodies’ web-sites (First reading—EM16006/11). There were no major interventions on this item.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second item was a report on the state of play from the Presidency on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down measures concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a Connected Continent. (First reading—EM13562/13 and 13555/13 + ADDs 1-2). This item began with a ‘state of play’ from the Presidency. This item included a request that the Council should look to reach a common position to enable commencement of negotiations with the European Parliament at the earliest opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK, Germany, Spain, Romania, Portugal, Malta, Poland and France endorsed this proposed approach. However, the majority of the remaining Member States opposed this idea. Many Member States also suggested
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;that further work was needed on roaming, including impact assessments, consultations and advice from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). With regard to the net neutrality proposal, Member States generally supported the Presidency’s proposal for a principles based approach. The UK intervention was as per the Pre-council statement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency concluded this item by noting that Council remained divided on this package, but would strive to work towards reaching a common position. The new Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society Günther Oettinger, intervened stating that the Commission would continue to push this package at political and technical level, to enable the completion of the negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There then followed information from the Presidency on a Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high level of network and information security across the Union. (First reading—EM6342/13). There were no major interventions on this item.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There then followed the adoption of draft council conclusions on Internet Governance. They were adopted with little comment from most Member States.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final major item was a ‘full table’ debate on the mid-term review of the Commission’s EU 2020 strategy. The ensuing debate was focussed on the Digital Agenda. Highlights included: many Member States linked progress on the Digital Agenda with the need to encourage jobs and growth within the EU; some signalled commitment to the digital single market; and a number of others highlighted the importance of broadband roll-out. The UK intervention was as per the Pre-council statement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Latvian delegation informed the Council of their priorities for their forthcoming Presidency before Council adjourned until the next meeting in Summer 2015.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice day on 4 December will begin with the Italian Presidency seeking a partial general approach on Chapter IX of the proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation. This deals with personal data processing for statistical, scientific and medical research purposes as well as provisions dealing with freedom of expression, employment and social protection. The Presidency is also looking to secure a partial general approach on the issue of public sector flexibility within the instrument. Although progress has been made in improving some aspects of the text, the Government is against the use of partial general approaches with regard to this dossier, given the amount of technical detail on which disagreement remains.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, they will hold an orientation debate on the regulatory One-Stop Shop which is intended to clarify in which Member State regulatory decision-making should take place where there is a cross-border element to the processing of personal data.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency will also provide a state of play update on the proposal for a Data Protection Directive, covering the processing of personal data in the investigation and detection of crime. At this stage, they are not looking to secure any agreement as there has been more limited progress than is the case on the proposed General Data Protection Regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be an orientation debate on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) proposal. The UK does not and will not participate in the EPPO. Debate will centre on the EPPO’s nomination and appointment procedures and how best to deliver independence within the “college” structure. While the UK plays an active role in the negotiations as a non-participating Member State, to shape and protect our position, we do not anticipate a need to intervene on these internal matters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency will present a partial general approach in relation to the Commission’s proposal to reform Eurojust, covering Chapters I-III and V-IX (omitting the Chapter on Data Protection) of the proposal with all references to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) removed. Given that Eurojust’s relationship with the EPPO is not covered in the revised text, it is impossible to take a definitive view on items such as governance arrangements. However, the Presidency text provided is broadly positive from a UK perspective. One of our key concerns was to ensure that Member States are not obliged to give additional powers to their National Members. The Presidency text is much improved in this regard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency will be aiming for a general approach on the Directive on Presumption of Innocence. The UK has not opted in to this proposal though monitors negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by a state of play debate on the Directive on Legal Aid; again the UK has not opted in to this proposal. The Council also seeks an
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;update on the state of play for the draft Directive on the fight against fraud by means of criminal law following the European Parliament’s first reading position of April 2014; the Council continues to discuss the content of the Directive ahead of trilogues.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, there will be a political agreement on the proposal for a revised Regulation on Insolvency proceedings. This represents the end of negotiations which began in January 2013 following a proposal from the Commission to modernise the existing Regulation, particularly to expand its scope to ensure businesses in the EU are rescued where possible and jobs preserved. The Council is being asked to reach political agreement on the text with a view to adoption in 2015. The UK Government supports this revision.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be orientation guidelines on the Regulation on promoting the free movement of citizens and businesses by simplifying the acceptance of certain public documents in the EU. This measure aims to abolish the process of “legalisation” of certain public documents. Legalisation is the formality to confirm the authenticity of an official signature or seal, The Regulation also proposes establishing EU multilingual forms. The Government supports the principle of reducing red tape and costs and welcomes recent amendments to both parts of the proposal which have limited the list of documents in scope to core civil status documents, such as birth, death and marriage certificates. It also welcomes ongoing discussions to replace the proposed multilingual forms with simple translations of the original national documents rather than creating translated standalone forms with their own evidential value.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency hopes to obtain a general approach to amend the European Small Claims Regulation. From a UK perspective the negotiations have been successful in achieving our main objectives; including returning to the current definition of what constitutes a cross-border case and ensuring that no arbitrary cap on court fees is imposed on Member States. The Government would have preferred a higher threshold for a small claim than €4,000 but understands that a compromise had to be found between the different positions of the Member States.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency is to provide a state of play report on the negotiations of the proposals on matrimonial property and the property consequences of registered partnerships. This is likely to state that while most technical issues have been finalised agreement on the proposals has not yet proved possible because of political concerns from some Member States regarding the status of same-sex relationships. As these proposals will be decided under the special legislative procedure for family measures, agreement must be obtained by unanimity. The UK has not opted in to either proposal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under AOB, there will be an update from the Presidency on the outcome of proceedings of the EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial meeting which took place in Washington on 12-13 November 2014. Finally, the Latvian delegation will give a presentation on their incoming Presidency Programme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Interior session on 5 December will begin in Mixed Committee with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland (non-EU Schengen States). We expect the Council to focus on the implementation of October’s
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JHA Council Conclusions on the response to migratory pressures, in particular those from the Mediterranean. The UK will press for full implementation of the Conclusions, in particular supporting further action in key countries of origin and transit, offering further support for the new Frontex operation in the Mediterranean, and pressing for further efforts to ensure Member States are meeting their responsibilities in the area of asylum and illegal migration.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present the latest biannual report on the functioning of the Schengen area, and Council will be given the opportunity to discuss its content. Although the UK does not participate in the border and visa elements of the Schengen acquis, the Government maintains a strong interest given the effect of illegal migration transiting the Schengen area on UK borders. We will call for the EU to consider the role that Schengen visa liberalisation with non-EU Member States can play in creating opportunities for immigration abuse, including the abuse of free movement rights by non-EU nationals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers will be invited to note a report highlighting the achievements of 15 years of Schengen evaluations under the Council’s management. Council Conclusions will then be discussed, to allow the continuation of the relevant evaluation working group beyond 27 November. This will retain Schengen evaluation expertise within the Council structure and assist Ministers in effective delivery of the new Schengen Evaluation Mechanism. The UK supports this move.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency currently plans a debate on Bulgarian and Romanian accession to Schengen, at the request of Romania and Bulgaria, who are seeking to finalise their accession to the border aspects of the Schengen acquis and then lower border controls with their EU neighbours. While the Italian Presidency would like to see this issue resolved at Council, accession remains blocked by a minority of Member States. The Presidency may well withdraw it from the agenda (as they did in October). If the debate goes ahead, Bulgaria and Romania are likely to express their frustration. As this currently concerns only borders elements of Schengen, the UK does not have a vote.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over lunch on the Interior day there will be an update on Passenger Name Records (PNR). The Council will consider how to proceed on PNR given the recent decision by the European Parliament to refer the EU Canada PNR Agreement to the European Court of Justice. It is possible the LIBE Committee will use the referral to further delay progress on the draft PNR directive. The UK supports speedy adoption of the PNR Directive, but we are clear that it should provide for intra-EEA PNR.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council will return to the issue of foreign fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq. Member States will be invited to discuss a number of issues based on a Presidency paper, as called for at the June European Council. The Council will also be asked to adopt the Guidelines which accompany the EU Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism, following the adoption of the updated Strategy earlier this year. The UK supports the Guidelines and has taken an active role in negotiations at working level, drawing on the UK’s experience of Prevent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under AOB, there will be an update from the Presidency on the outcome of proceedings of the EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial meeting which took place in Washington DC on 12-13 November 2014. The Latvian delegation will give a presentation on their incoming Presidency Programme.”

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and Minister for Intellectual Property (Baroness Neville-Rolfe) has today made the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Competitiveness Council will take place on Thursday 4 December and Friday 5 December. Baroness Neville-Rolfe will represent the UK on day one (industry and internal market). UK representation for the second day of the Council is to be confirmed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal market and industry substantive agenda items are: proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on package travel and assisted travel arrangements, proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cableway installations and proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on personal protective equipment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the travel package proposal is to update consumer protection legislation as it applies to holiday arrangements. This is to reflect the impact of technological developments facilitated by the internet, and the emergence of low cost airlines, since 1990.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cableway proposal seeks to address some of the difficulties that have been experienced by some member states in implementing the existing Cableways Directive. It provides clarification on the scope of the cableway installations designed for transport and leisure purposes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personal protective proposal is to replace the existing Personal Protective Equipment Directive, which regulates the placing of personal protective equipment (PPE) on the EU market, by laying down the health and safety requirements to which it must conform.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be five non-legislative agenda items discussed at the Council: a presentation on industrial competitiveness - an agenda for jobs and growth, a policy debate on
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;enhancing the single market in all its dimensions, draft council conclusions on smart regulation, draft council conclusions on strengthening tourism by leveraging Europe’s cultural, natural and maritime heritage and draft council conclusions on customs risk management.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be a number of non-legislative agenda items discussed on the second day of the council: a policy debate on science with and for society draft council conclusions on Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA), a European Research Area (ERA) Progress Report 2014; and Research and Innovation as sources of renewed growth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, on the space element of the Council there will be an exchange of views on the competitiveness of the European space sector as a key driver for the European economy. We will take this opportunity to set out UK views and council conclusions on underpinning the European space renaissance: orientations and future challenges.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My rt hon Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Theresa May) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 22 July, I informed the House that I intended to reform elements of the police disciplinary system to improve transparency and justice and to strengthen protections for police whistleblowers. Today I am launching a six week public consultation on these measures. Subject to the consultation I intend to implement these measures before the end of this Parliament.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integrity of the men and women who work in the police service of England and Wales is critical to public trust in policing. Real or perceived misconduct or corruption dents that trust and makes policing by
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;consent more difficult. The vast majority of police officers behave appropriately and conscientiously, which makes it even more important to root out misconduct and malpractice and hold those responsible to account.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to ensure that the systems and processes that deal with misconduct by police officers are robust, independent and transparent to the public. In July I commissioned Major-General Chip Chapman to review the police disciplinary system. His report has been completed and I will consult on his recommendations for wide ranging reform shortly. That consultation will also include proposals to fundamentally reform the police complaints system and further protections for police whistleblowers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation I am launching today focuses on specific reforms that can be made in the short term that will have a significant impact in making the current system more robust, independent and transparent until such point when more fundamental reforms can be implemented.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve justice, I am consulting on a power for disciplinary hearing panels to remove or adjust the compensation payments due to chief officers on termination of their appointment where a disciplinary finding is made against them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To introduce greater independence into the way police disciplinary hearings are conducted and ensure judgements are legally sound, I am consulting on the introduction of legally-qualified chairs to conduct police disciplinary hearings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To strengthen protections for police whistleblowers and ensure they can come forward with confidence, I am consulting on proposals to ensure whistleblowers will not be subject to disciplinary action for taking the necessary steps to report a concern and that any reprisals against them will be taken seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to improve transparency and accountability to the public and ensure that the robust response that the police take to misconduct is both visible and open to public scrutiny, I am consulting on holding police disciplinary hearings and appeals in public.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that all those with an interest in these matters will respond to the consultation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the consultation document will be placed in the Library of the House.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation I am launching today focuses on specific reforms that can be made in the short term that will have a significant impact in making the current system more robust, independent and transparent until such point when more fundamental reforms can be implemented.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve justice, I am consulting on a power for disciplinary hearing panels to remove or adjust the compensation payments due to chief officers on termination of their appointment where a disciplinary finding is made against them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To introduce greater independence into the way police disciplinary hearings are conducted and ensure judgements are legally sound, I am consulting on the introduction of legally-qualified chairs to conduct police disciplinary hearings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To strengthen protections for police whistleblowers and ensure they can come forward with confidence, I am consulting on proposals to ensure whistleblowers will not be subject to disciplinary action for taking the necessary steps to report a concern and that any reprisals against them will be taken seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to improve transparency and accountability to the public and ensure that the robust response that the police take to misconduct is both visible and open to public scrutiny, I am consulting on holding police disciplinary hearings and appeals in public.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that all those with an interest in these matters will respond to the consultation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the consultation document will be placed in the Library of the House.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My hon friend the Parliamentary Under Secretary for State, Department of Health (George Freeman) has made the following written ministerial statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing an external review of the pathways for the development, assessment, and adoption of innovative medicines and medical technology.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advances including digital diagnostics, cell therapy, genomics and stratified medicines are fundamentally changing the healthcare landscape and the way in which these advances are developed and utilised. These advances have real potential to transform prevention and treatment, improving patient outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they are increasingly challenging traditional systems of regulation, assessment and adoption, the subject of growing public and professional debate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Innovative Medicines and Medical Technology review will consider how our healthcare and regulatory systems can best respond and adapt to this new landscape of innovation. We are strongly placed to do this: our £1 billion National Institute for Health Research programme provides a platform for testing and evaluating medical innovations, and we have internationally-renowned expertise in evidence-based assessments of the health economics of drugs and devices
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review will consider how to speed up access for NHS patients to cost-effective new diagnostics, medicines and devices. It will focus on innovative types of product: in particular, drugs based on stratified medicine, new diagnostics, and digital health technologies. It will examine the pathway from ‘first in human’ trials, through licensing and health technology appraisal, to commissioning, reimbursement and clinical practice. It will set out both short and long-term options for action by Government and relevant bodies (including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and NHS England).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect the review to recognise the public spending environment in which the NHS operates, and the overriding need to ensure value for money. It will respect the parameters of the 2014 Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme for branded medicines, and take account of the existing statutory responsibilities of NHS bodies and the European legislative frameworks for the regulation and procurement of medicines and medical technologies. It will start early in 2015 following the appointment of an independent organisation to lead the work, and report back in the summer.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend, the Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin) has made the following Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform the House that following a rigorous competition I intend to award the Intercity East Coast franchise to Inter City Railways Limited, a joint venture between Stagecoach Transport Holdings Limited and Virgin Holdings limited, pending the successful completion of a standstill period of at least 10 days.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new franchise will run for 8 years from 1st March 2015 to 31&lt;Sup&gt;st&lt;/Sup&gt; March 2023 with a further extension of 1
year callable at my
discretion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a significant step forward not just for this vital and historic route but for our whole transport system. Traffic on our railways has more than doubled since privatisation from 750 million to 1.6 billion journeys a year. With Network Rail we’re investing £38 billion in maintaining and improving the system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new franchise will realise the benefits of this investment. It will be good for towns and cities up and down the east coast of England and Scotland, and good for our economy and jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This franchise will provide over £140m in investment for passengers: faster journey times; new trains; more services; 50% more capacity; lower headline fares; free Wi-Fi and connects five towns that have never been connected to this franchise before. It provides strengthened services to the north of England, Scotland and Lincolnshire. We asked for transformation; our new partner will achieve this with what will be a renewed railway.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach/ Virgin have long term plans to build on the work done by the public sector operator and improve the franchise for passengers. Stagecoach/ Virgin will also deliver for taxpayers by providing an improved premium of £3.3 billion (nominal) to Government over the next 8 years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flexibility in our specification has allowed Stagecoach/ Virgin to use its experience and put together a new timetable that not only continues service levels to every current mainline station but significantly enhances the levels of service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach/ Virgin will strengthen the vital links from London to Scotland; all the way along the route as far as Aberdeen and Inverness. Passengers will benefit from regular, faster, more frequent cross border services to Falkirk, Stirling and Edinburgh, with journeys between London and Edinburgh regularly taking just 4 hours by May 2020.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England will also receive greatly improved services. By May 2020, Leeds will see regular journey times of 2 hours while Leeds, Bradford, Shipley, Harrogate and Horsforth will see more services each day when compared to the current timetable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Thornaby, Huddersfield and Dewsbury, will all get services on InterCity East Coast for the first time as a result of this competition and Lincoln which gets just one train a day to London under the current operator will get one every two hours by May 2019 with the new one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these destinations will be served by the new Intercity Express Trains by May 2020. They will be built in the heart of the North East at the new plant in Newton Aycliffe. These trains will provide more reliable services, more seats and more leg and luggage space. The new operator will provide 50% more capacity across the InterCity East Coast and a 40% increase in morning peak seats to and from Kings Cross. Stagecoach/ Virgin plan better catering with more staff on board trains to help passengers. They will not make passengers wait for the new trains to bring improvements. Stagecoach/ Virgin will perform a major refurbishment of the existing fleet. This will bring them up to a high standard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach/Virgin plans to reduce some of the most expensive standard class fares on the franchise by up to 10% from May next year. Passengers will also have the chance to register to get automatic delay-repay payments at times of disruption and benefit from a loyalty and rewards scheme. Stations will see investment too with more car parking spaces, additional secure cycling facilities and electric vehicle charging points.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A benefits package worth £5m will be available to all of its employees. Stagecoach/Virgin will invest heavily in skills, not just for their staff but for the railway as a whole. There will be a graduate programme and new apprenticeships, and the operator will create the National Academy for Rail Professional Education with bases in London, York and Derby. This will provide good training at a reduced cost; helping the whole of the industry by reducing the barriers to employment in it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This award is further proof that private competition is good for passengers, local communities and taxpayers.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend, the Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin) has made the following Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform the House that following a rigorous competition I intend to award the Intercity East Coast franchise to Inter City Railways Limited, a joint venture between Stagecoach Transport Holdings Limited and Virgin Holdings limited, pending the successful completion of a standstill period of at least 10 days.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new franchise will run for 8 years from 1st March 2015 to 31&lt;Sup&gt;st&lt;/Sup&gt; March 2023 with a further extension of 1
year callable at my
discretion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a significant step forward not just for this vital and historic route but for our whole transport system. Traffic on our railways has more than doubled since privatisation from 750 million to 1.6 billion journeys a year. With Network Rail we’re investing £38 billion in maintaining and improving the system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new franchise will realise the benefits of this investment. It will be good for towns and cities up and down the east coast of England and Scotland, and good for our economy and jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This franchise will provide over £140m in investment for passengers: faster journey times; new trains; more services; 50% more capacity; lower headline fares; free Wi-Fi and connects five towns that have never been connected to this franchise before. It provides strengthened services to the north of England, Scotland and Lincolnshire. We asked for transformation; our new partner will achieve this with what will be a renewed railway.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach/ Virgin have long term plans to build on the work done by the public sector operator and improve the franchise for passengers. Stagecoach/ Virgin will also deliver for taxpayers by providing an improved premium of £3.3 billion (nominal) to Government over the next 8 years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flexibility in our specification has allowed Stagecoach/ Virgin to use its experience and put together a new timetable that not only continues service levels to every current mainline station but significantly enhances the levels of service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach/ Virgin will strengthen the vital links from London to Scotland; all the way along the route as far as Aberdeen and Inverness. Passengers will benefit from regular, faster, more frequent cross border services to Falkirk, Stirling and Edinburgh, with journeys between London and Edinburgh regularly taking just 4 hours by May 2020.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England will also receive greatly improved services. By May 2020, Leeds will see regular journey times of 2 hours while Leeds, Bradford, Shipley, Harrogate and Horsforth will see more services each day when compared to the current timetable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Thornaby, Huddersfield and Dewsbury, will all get services on InterCity East Coast for the first time as a result of this competition and Lincoln which gets just one train a day to London under the current operator will get one every two hours by May 2019 with the new one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these destinations will be served by the new Intercity Express Trains by May 2020. They will be built in the heart of the North East at the new plant in Newton Aycliffe. These trains will provide more reliable services, more seats and more leg and luggage space. The new operator will provide 50% more capacity across the InterCity East Coast and a 40% increase in morning peak seats to and from Kings Cross. Stagecoach/ Virgin plan better catering with more staff on board trains to help passengers. They will not make passengers wait for the new trains to bring improvements. Stagecoach/ Virgin will perform a major refurbishment of the existing fleet. This will bring them up to a high standard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach/Virgin plans to reduce some of the most expensive standard class fares on the franchise by up to 10% from May next year. Passengers will also have the chance to register to get automatic delay-repay payments at times of disruption and benefit from a loyalty and rewards scheme. Stations will see investment too with more car parking spaces, additional secure cycling facilities and electric vehicle charging points.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A benefits package worth £5m will be available to all of its employees. Stagecoach/Virgin will invest heavily in skills, not just for their staff but for the railway as a whole. There will be a graduate programme and new apprenticeships, and the operator will create the National Academy for Rail Professional Education with bases in London, York and Derby. This will provide good training at a reduced cost; helping the whole of the industry by reducing the barriers to employment in it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This award is further proof that private competition is good for passengers, local communities and taxpayers.

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Honourable Friend, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Robert Goodwill) </str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Honourable Friend, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Transport (Robert Goodwill) has made the following Ministerial Statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will attend the last Transport Council under the Italian Presidency (the Presidency) taking place in Brussels on Wednesday 3 December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first item on the agenda will be a public debate on the Draft Council conclusions on Transport infrastructure and the Trans European Network. The UK has worked constructively with like-minded Member
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States to help the Italian Presidency develop these Conclusions which seek to align Transport with the EU 2020 Strategy by recognising the value that investment in building and operating transport infrastructure and creating efficient networks can bring to growth and jobs. The UK will support the adoption of the Conclusions as drafted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Council will be asked to agree in principle a proposed Council Decision authorising Member States to sign the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, of the International Maritime Organisation. This is a procedural decision giving Member States permission to accede to the Convention. It is necessary due to Union competence over the mutual recognition of the qualifications of fishing vessel personnel by virtue of Directive 2005/36/EC (which provides for mutual recognition across a range of professions). Some aspects of the Decision as originally proposed were unacceptable to the UK, for example the use of inappropriate legal bases and a general lack of clarity over the scope of relevant competence. Through negotiation the UK has secured significant improvements to the Decision and the UK is now content with the text to be agreed at Transport Council.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency will aim for a general approach on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the implementation of the Single European Sky. The UK has been working hard with the Italian Presidency and other Member States to secure our objectives on this Regulation. As a result I am pleased to say that we secured redrafting which has resolved the vast majority of concerns we had on this proposal. In terms of Gibraltar, our firm position is that it is part of the EU and must remain in the scope of EU aviation legislation such as SES I expect further discussions to take place on this issue during the Council meeting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next on the agenda is a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) 216/2008 in the field of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation facilities. This proposal is part of a package with the Single European Sky (SES II+) Regulation and transfers some SES provisions into the European Aviation Safety Authority system in order to simplify and clarify the regulation framework for the safety of air traffic management. As such we were very supportive and had just a few concerns which we have been able to resolve. We are therefore ready to support this proposal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this will be a progress report on the proposal to amend Directive 2012/34 establishing a Single European Railway Area, as regards the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail and the governance of the railway infrastructure, and the related proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 concerning the opening of the market for domestic passenger transport services by rail. The Government supports the Presidency on their progress report, which is a very thorough summary of discussions to date. The suggestions for future options form an excellent foundation and mean that an agreement on the market pillar is now within reach of future Presidencies. It is important that the remaining barriers to the single market in rail services are addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a general approach on the proposal to repeal Regulation 1192/69 on common rules for the normalisation of the accounts of railway undertakings. The UK supports the repeal of this Regulation which has become outdated and inconsistent with more recent EU railway legislation. It is a welcome example of legislative simplification and deregulation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Any Other Business, the Commission will provide information on EU satellite navigation programmes. The Presidency will provide information on the recent European Aviation Safety Authority event on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. The Lithuanian delegation will provide information on the road transport situation in the context of detailed inspections of Lithuanian vehicles recently introduced by Russian authorities. Also, the Latvian delegation will provide information on the work programme of their forthcoming Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

The scheme provides a sovereign-backed guarantee to help infrastructure projects raise debt finance. Guarantees for up to £40 billion in aggregate can be offered under the initiative.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is confirming that it has approved a guarantee for £291.5m to the University of Northampton for the construction of its new Waterside Campus.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My hon Friend the Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology (Mr Philip Dunne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I informed the House on 31 March that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) was launching the sale of the Defence Support Group’s land business. Following a strong competition, I am pleased to announce that Babcock Land Ltd has been selected as the preferred bidder. I will make a further statement to the House with final details of the transaction in the New Year, after a contract has been signed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also informed the House in March that MOD would be retaining the Defence Support Group’s air business, the Electronics and Components Business Unit (ECBU). I am pleased to announce that ECBU will become the Defence Electronics and Components Agency (DECA), a new MOD Trading Agency, from 1 April 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECA will continue to provide support to a diverse range of electronic, avionic and mechanical equipment for both fixed wing and rotary platforms. This will include the provision of a specialist avionics obsolescence management capability. DECA’s Trading Agency model, based on an executive agency, will allow it to continue trading with MOD and industry customers in a similar way to how the ECBU currently operates within the Defence Support Group.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Astor of Hever: My Lords, we recognise the huge debt that we owe to our Afghan employees, and we are working with the Home Office and the Afghan authorities to avoid any unreasonable delays in relocation. We take intimidation very seriously and trained police investigate claims. We provide security advice and relocation in-country—or, in extremis, back to the United Kingdom. We are aware of no staff killed or seriously injured off duty. We very much welcome the noble Baroness’s ideas on interpreter opportunities and we are working closely with the Home Office to try to take this forward.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Astor of Hever: My Lords, we recognise the huge debt that we owe to our Afghan employees, and we are working with the Home Office and the Afghan authorities to avoid any unreasonable delays in relocation. We take intimidation very seriously and trained police investigate claims. We provide security advice and relocation in-country—or, in extremis, back to the United Kingdom. We are aware of no staff killed or seriously injured off duty. We very much welcome the noble Baroness’s ideas on interpreter opportunities and we are working closely with the Home Office to try to take this forward.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Hon Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Helen Grant) has made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing the start of the Triennial Review of UK Sport and Sport England. As executive non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPB), UK Sport and Sport England are required to undergo a Triennial Review. The joint UK Sport/Sport England review will have two principal aims, represented by two stages.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first stage will provide a robust challenge for the continuing need for the functions performed by both UK Sport and Sport England, and, if there is,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;whether some or all of these functions should be delivered by alternative delivery models or continued delivery by a Non- Departmental Public Body (NDPB).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is agreed that the functions of each should continue to be delivered by NDPBs, the second stage will review the organisational control and governance arrangements in place to ensure that they are compliant with the recognised principles of good corporate governance and delivering good value for money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure, efficiency and effectiveness of the two bodies will be considered as part of both stages. This will include an assessment of how well the two bodies work together, their progress against the conditions set in January 2013 on deciding not to merge them and the scope for further savings. The findings at both stages of the Review will be examined by a Challenge Group.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details of the review and a survey seeking evidence about UK Sport and Sport England can be found on the DCMS website at https://www.gov.uk/government/news/triennial-review-of-uk-sport-and-sport-england
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will inform the House of the outcome of the Review when it is completed and copies of the report of the Review will be placed in the Libraries of the House.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Hon friend, the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries (Ed Vaizey) has made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council will take place in Brussels on 25th November. I will represent the UK at the culture, and audiovisual sections, and the Deputy Permanent Representative to the EU, Shan Morgan, will represent the UK at the sport section.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture and Audiovisual
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council will be invited to adopt draft Council Conclusions on European Audiovisual policy in the digital era. The UK welcomes these conclusions, which set the main goals of European audiovisual policy, including high quality content, full cross-border circulation of European audiovisual works, and the assurance of equal conditions for competitiveness for audiovisual media service providers within the single market.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will then consider draft Council Conclusions on the Commission’s work plan for culture for the period 2015-2018. Although we are supportive of the work plan itself, which reflects UK priorities for the culture sector, we do not accept references in the text of the conclusions recommending the equal treatment of e-books and printed books for VAT purposes. This issue is outside the competence of the Council—it is a matter for ECOFIN Council and I therefore intend to block the conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council is expected to adopt conclusions on participatory governance of cultural heritage, which seek to encourage an open and transparent system of cultural governance, and to promote a participatory approach to cultural policy-making. This is concordant with UK policy, and I intend to support.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a policy debate on the contribution of the cultural and creative sectors to the Europe 2020 strategy. Whilst acknowledging the importance of the sectors themselves, we seek to avoid any linkage with the review of the strategy due in 2015, which is focussed on structural market reforms, better regulation, and jobs and growth. I shall make it clear in my intervention that it would be an unhelpful distraction to the Europe 2020 strategy to add references to specific sectors, especially those relating to culture, where it is hard to set quantitative targets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sport
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to the sport sector, the Council is expected to adopt draft conclusions on sport as a driver of innovation and economic growth. This is in line with UK policy on the sector, and I intend to support.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a policy debate on sport and physical activity at school age, where I will demonstrate that the UK is committed to providing opportunities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in sport for all children regardless of age, gender, or ability: that we are committing significant funding to school sport: and that we challenge the supposition in the Italian Presidency paper on this item that rates of participation in sport are decreasing amongst school age children.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Business
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Commission will present an update on the current state of negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, between the EU and the United States of America.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that some Member States will seek to ensure that the culture and audio-visual sectors remain excluded from these negotiations. I do not intend to intervene, as no debate has been set for this item, but if necessary will point out that the Culture Council is not the forum for raising trade issues. We should focus our energy on reaching an ambitious agreement, and look for movement on significant areas already covered in the mandate. We should aim for further progress in the negotiations before exposing our red lines to the US.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a report back on the latest Executive Committee and Foundation Board meetings of the World Anti-Doping Agency which took place on 15 and 16 November.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally there will be a presentation from Latvia on their work programme and priorities for their forthcoming Presidency of the Council, which will run for six months from January 2015.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will then consider draft Council Conclusions on the Commission’s work plan for culture for the period 2015-2018. Although we are supportive of the work plan itself, which reflects UK priorities for the culture sector, we do not accept references in the text of the conclusions recommending the equal treatment of e-books and printed books for VAT purposes. This issue is outside the competence of the Council—it is a matter for ECOFIN Council and I therefore intend to block the conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council is expected to adopt conclusions on participatory governance of cultural heritage, which seek to encourage an open and transparent system of cultural governance, and to promote a participatory approach to cultural policy-making. This is concordant with UK policy, and I intend to support.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a policy debate on the contribution of the cultural and creative sectors to the Europe 2020 strategy. Whilst acknowledging the importance of the sectors themselves, we seek to avoid any linkage with the review of the strategy due in 2015, which is focussed on structural market reforms, better regulation, and jobs and growth. I shall make it clear in my intervention that it would be an unhelpful distraction to the Europe 2020 strategy to add references to specific sectors, especially those relating to culture, where it is hard to set quantitative targets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sport
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to the sport sector, the Council is expected to adopt draft conclusions on sport as a driver of innovation and economic growth. This is in line with UK policy on the sector, and I intend to support.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a policy debate on sport and physical activity at school age, where I will demonstrate that the UK is committed to providing opportunities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;in sport for all children regardless of age, gender, or ability: that we are committing significant funding to school sport: and that we challenge the supposition in the Italian Presidency paper on this item that rates of participation in sport are decreasing amongst school age children.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Business
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Commission will present an update on the current state of negotiations on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, between the EU and the United States of America.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that some Member States will seek to ensure that the culture and audio-visual sectors remain excluded from these negotiations. I do not intend to intervene, as no debate has been set for this item, but if necessary will point out that the Culture Council is not the forum for raising trade issues. We should focus our energy on reaching an ambitious agreement, and look for movement on significant areas already covered in the mandate. We should aim for further progress in the negotiations before exposing our red lines to the US.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then be a report back on the latest Executive Committee and Foundation Board meetings of the World Anti-Doping Agency which took place on 15 and 16 November.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally there will be a presentation from Latvia on their work programme and priorities for their forthcoming Presidency of the Council, which will run for six months from January 2015.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Hon friend, the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries (Ed Vaizey) has made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council was held in Brussels on 25&lt;Sup&gt;th&lt;/Sup&gt; November. I represented the UK for the
cultural and audiovisual section of the Council and Shan Morgan, the
UK’s Deputy Permanent Representative, represented the UK for the
sport section of the
Council.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture and audiovisual
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council was invited to adopt Council Conclusions relating to European audiovisual policy in the digital era. The UK supported the adoption of these Council Conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council then invited Culture Ministers to state their positions on the contested wording in the draft conclusions on the EU work plan for Culture (2015-2018), which related to equal VAT treatment of e-books and physical books.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noted that tax issues were the sole responsibility of ECOFIN, and successfully pushed back against the contested wording. The final text represented a good outcome for the UK, and was met with broad agreement by all delegations. The Presidency also reached an agreement on actions for culture in the EU’s external relations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having concluded the work plan, the Presidency invited Culture Ministers to discuss the contribution of the cultural and creative sectors to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Whilst the majority supported culture being included in the Europe 2020 strategy, many delegations also warned that by doing so culture would be reduced to no more than a statistic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK agreed that whilst culture did have a contribution to make to the goals of the strategy, it was not substantial enough to merit its inclusion in the strategy itself, which should remain focused on key contributors to jobs and economic growth. Others argued that by incorporating culture into the strategy,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the EU would be able to ensure that culture was mainstreamed throughout all policy areas. Some delegations highlighted that by including culture in the Europe 2020 strategy, European funding that culture was not currently eligible for would become available.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sport
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council was invited to adopt Council Conclusions relating to sport as a driver for innovation and growth. The UK supported the adoption of these Council Conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delegates were invited to discuss sport and physical activity at school age. Although some Member States had experienced a decline in sport participation and others an increase, there was general agreement amongst all delegations that participation in sport offered many benefits and skills to young people: and that people that had participated in sport at a young age achieved better academic results and were more employable than young people who had not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges identified during the discussion was how to motivate young people to opt for sport rather than computer games or other sedentary activities in their free time. The UK stated that major sporting events help to motivate young people to get involved in sport, as witnessed in the UK after London hosted the Olympic Games in 2012. All Member States stressed that another main challenge governments faced was ensuring that sport on offer was inclusive. Several delegations cited data that showed girls were most likely to drop-out of sports clubs early on or not participate in sport at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Business
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission provided a brief update on the state of play of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incoming Latvian Presidency gave a summary on its priorities, which would include cultural heritage, innovative architecture and the results of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 Strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a report from the latest meeting of the World Anti Doping Agency and a presentation on the Council of Europe’s Convention against the manipulation of sports competitions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the incoming Latvian Presidency set out its priorities in the field of sport, which would primarily focus on the role of sport in fostering skills and competences.

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Philip</str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Right Honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Philip Hammond) has made the following written Ministerial statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House will be aware that serious allegations have been made by former employees of the authorities of the British Overseas Territory of St Helena. These allegations involve claims relating to child abuse in the Territory, police corruption and incompetence, and a conspiracy by the St Helena Government (SHG), the FCO and DFID to cover these up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are bound to take such allegations extremely seriously. Former FCO Minister for Overseas Territories, the Hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) announced to the House of Commons on 21 July the establishment of an independent Inquiry to establish the truth of these allegations and make recommendations as appropriate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform the House that I have agreed that Ms. Sasha Wass QC should lead this Inquiry. Ms. Wass is a very accomplished barrister with substantial
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;professional experience of dealing with these kinds of issues. I am confident that she will lead this Inquiry with great rigour, fairness and sensitivity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matters of child safety require discretion and confidentiality. The issues self-evidently involve vulnerable people, whose privacy must be protected and confidences respected. I am certain this Inquiry will do that. But it is also important that this process is as transparent as possible. That is why I am today publishing the Inquiry’s Terms of Reference, agreed with Sasha Wass, so the full scope of the issues is clear to everyone. I am also placing a copy of the Terms of Reference in the Libraries of both Houses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that Ms. Wass will conduct an initial review of the allegations contained in various documents, including the independent reports produced by others in response to specific concerns raised previously. We are also providing Sasha Wass with full disclosure of the UK papers that relate to these allegations. Ms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wass will then make a judgement about the scope of her investigations, including on the appointment of a team of independent experts to help her with this task. I also understand that Ms. Wass will travel to St Helena once this initial phase of her work is completed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since allegations relating to child safety were first raised in late 2012, the British Government has been swift to ensure that they were investigated appropriately. We commissioned the respected Lucy Faithfull Foundation to conduct an initial review, which was then followed by an investigation by Northumbria Police. The reports made important recommendations, which the authorities on St Helena are working to implement with support from the UK. A number of arrests and convictions for child sex offences have also occurred.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, however, needs to be done. This new Inquiry will not be quick. But it will be thorough. And I am confident that the facts will be established.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Michael Fallon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Future Reserves 2020 (FR20), the planned five year growth of the Reserve Forces’ trained strength was set out in a statement to the House on 19 December 2013 (column 121WS). This included annual trained strength targets along with intake targets. I am announcing a public consultation on the reporting of performance against these targets to ensure a consistent approach is taken across all three single Services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each Service uses its Reserve Forces differently so, when the FR20 targets were set, each Service proposed some small variations in the groups of Volunteer Reserves that should be counted. This has resulted in inconsistent reporting of the number of volunteers against the targets. The Army excludes Volunteer Reserve personnel serving temporarily on Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS), whereas the RAF excludes Volunteer Reserve personnel serving on either FTRS or Additional Duties Commitments (ADC) from their FR20 trained strength numbers. For both the Army and RAF these personnel are included in the numbers once their FTRS or ADC service ends and they reassume part-time Volunteer status. These complications do not exist in the Maritime Reserves, as the Royal Navy has always counted Volunteer Reserves serving on FTRS or ADC towards its FR20 targets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a consistent approach to reporting across all three Services, the MOD proposes that all Volunteer Reserve personnel serving on FTRS and ADC should be counted towards the FR20 trained strength targets. The targets themselves will not change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targets also need to reflect the use of Sponsored Reserves as part of our overall Reserve requirement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public consultation sets out the proposal in more detail. All responses to the consultation will be considered before any decision is taken to revise the population definitions. Performance against the FR20 targets is reported in the UK Armed Forces Quarterly Personnel Report (QPR) National Statistics publication. This may be amended following the outcome of the public consultation.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a consistent approach to reporting across all three Services, the MOD proposes that all Volunteer Reserve personnel serving on FTRS and ADC should be counted towards the FR20 trained strength targets. The targets themselves will not change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targets also need to reflect the use of Sponsored Reserves as part of our overall Reserve requirement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public consultation sets out the proposal in more detail. All responses to the consultation will be considered before any decision is taken to revise the population definitions. Performance against the FR20 targets is reported in the UK Armed Forces Quarterly Personnel Report (QPR) National Statistics publication. This may be amended following the outcome of the public consultation.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Justice and Civil Liberties (Simon Hughes) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am today announcing the start of the triennial review of the Information Commissioner’s Office. Triennial reviews are part of the Government’s commitment to making sure that non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) continue to have regular independent challenge.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review will identify and examine the key functions of the Information Commissioner’s Office and consider how best the functions can be delivered, including whether they should continue to exist at arm’s length
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from Government. Should the review conclude that the functions should still be performed by the Information Commissioner’s Office in its current form, it will go on to consider the potential for securing efficiencies and examine whether their control and governance arrangements continue to meet the recognised principles of good corporate governance. The findings at both stages of the review will be examined by a challenge group.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details of the review, including how to submit evidence to it, can be found on the Ministry of Justice website at: https://consult.justice.gov.uk/. The deadline for responses is 16th January 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conducting the Triennial Review, officials will be engaging with a broad range of stakeholders and users of the Information Commissioner’s Office. The review will be aligned with guidance published in 2014 by the Cabinet Office: Guidance on Reviews of Non Departmental Public Bodies. I will inform the House of the outcome of the review when it is completed and copies of the report of the review will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.”

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Eric Pickles) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter saw some of the most severe weather on record, and thousands of homes and businesses were flooded.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extension of flood recovery schemes to all of 2013/14
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government responded to these events by making relief available for those flooded, both from council tax and business rates, as well as by helping householders make their homes more resilient to future flooding. However Government is today recognising the hardship caused in other parts of England by flooding earlier in 2013/14 by announcing an extension of the following Government flood recovery support schemes: the Department for Communities and Local Government council tax and business rates relief schemes, the Severe Weather Recovery Fund (Communities Element); the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ Repair and Renew Grant; and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills’ Business Support Scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make a real difference for those who suffered the appalling effects of flooding throughout the entirety of the 2013/14 financial year. My officials will be writing on behalf of the Government to all local authorities in England advising them of how to apply along with the terms and conditions of the various schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellwin consultation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter, to help local authorities deal with the immediate costs of the severe weather, the Government activated the Bellwin Scheme of Emergency Financial Assistance to Local Authorities, and in recognition of the unique scale of the flooding, made the terms of the scheme more generous. This included lowering the threshold above which the Government will compensate, and reimbursing 100% of local authorities’ costs above those lower thresholds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are today announcing a consultation on making those changes to the Bellwin Scheme permanent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparedness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Rt Hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Elizabeth Truss) will be making a full statement on winter preparedness. However, my Department has already done a great deal of work on this. We continue to engage with local government to consider how councils can build on and improve their emergency support outside normal
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;business hours, including clearly publicising their emergency contact numbers; being a more visible part of the local response; and giving clear advice to residents and businesses on how to plan for emergencies. On 30 October DCLG published, jointly with the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, the “Local authorities’ preparedness for civil emergencies: a good practice guide” to help local authorities ensure they are well-prepared to respond to a civil emergency in their local area. Ministerial colleagues will be meeting with leaders from a number of local authorities over the coming weeks to discuss preparedness to respond to winter weather and flooding in particular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery progress report
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also right that I also update the House on the recovery progress from last winter’s severe weather events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is today publishing a flood recovery progress report updating on Government support and local authority activity over the past 11 months, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House. My Department has talked to local responders, including volunteers, businesses and communities to understand how the local flood response and recovery process was delivered in local areas; exploring with them lessons that we can all learn about the effects of last winter’s severe weather; and working with them to reduce the risk of damaging floods in future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, once again I would like to thank all those from local authorities, the emergency services, the armed forces, community and voluntary groups, the staff of the Environment Agency and transport workers who worked so hard throughout last winter, often in appalling conditions, to support and help people during the severe weather.

We continue to engage with local government to consider how councils can build on and improve their emergency support outside normal
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;business hours, including clearly publicising their emergency contact numbers; being a more visible part of the local response; and giving clear advice to residents and businesses on how to plan for emergencies. On 30 October DCLG published, jointly with the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, the “Local authorities’ preparedness for civil emergencies: a good practice guide” to help local authorities ensure they are well-prepared to respond to a civil emergency in their local area. Ministerial colleagues will be meeting with leaders from a number of local authorities over the coming weeks to discuss preparedness to respond to winter weather and flooding in particular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery progress report
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also right that I also update the House on the recovery progress from last winter’s severe weather events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is today publishing a flood recovery progress report updating on Government support and local authority activity over the past 11 months, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House. My Department has talked to local responders, including volunteers, businesses and communities to understand how the local flood response and recovery process was delivered in local areas; exploring with them lessons that we can all learn about the effects of last winter’s severe weather; and working with them to reduce the risk of damaging floods in future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, once again I would like to thank all those from local authorities, the emergency services, the armed forces, community and voluntary groups, the staff of the Environment Agency and transport workers who worked so hard throughout last winter, often in appalling conditions, to support and help people during the severe weather.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Danny Alexander) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government’s commitment to infrastructure is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan. High quality infrastructure boosts productivity and competitiveness, and can unlock economic potential across the UK.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Infrastructure Plan 2014 sets out an ambitious infrastructure vision for the next parliament and beyond, reinforcing the government’s commitment to investing in infrastructure and improving its quality and performance. It also summarises the substantial progress that has been made during this parliament, including the completion of over 2500 different infrastructure projects or schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Infrastructure Plan is underpinned by the infrastructure pipeline, which is a forward-looking, bottom-up assessment of planned public and private infrastructure investment in the UK. The refreshed infrastructure pipeline sets out over £460 billion of planned public and private investment to the end of the decade and beyond across the key infrastructure sectors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new announcements contained in the National Infrastructure Plan are as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood defences
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has published its 6-year programme of investment in flood defences, allocating the £2.3bn capital funding provided at the 2013 Spending Round
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interconnectors
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will ensure that interconnectors can participate in the 2015 capacity auction, estimating the eligible capacity of each interconnector on a case-by-case basis
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swansea Tidal Lagoon
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will start closer discussions with Tidal Lagoon (Swansea Bay) plc to establish whether a tidal lagoon at Swansea Bay is affordable and value for money for consumers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Guarantee scheme: Moorside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HM Treasury has reached a cooperation agreement with Toshiba, GDF Suez and NuGen with the aim of issuing a statement of intent to provide a guarantee to assist the financing of a new nuclear power plant at Moorside, subject to due diligence and ministerial approval.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadband connection vouchers
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connection vouchers - the government will provide up to £40m to extend the SME connection voucher scheme to March 2016 and to more cities. Vouchers will be available on a first come, first served basis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;700MHz spectrum change of use
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details of the clearance process for high-value spectrum will be set out in 2015 ahead of a further auction of mobile broadband spectrum, subject to the development of delivery options by DCMS and Ofcom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northstowe
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will take forward development at Northstowe, to support accelerated delivery of up to 10,000 homes, and evaluate the feasibility and economic impact of using this model at a wider scale to support and accelerate housing supply
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barking Riverside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will agree a principal heads of terms agreement for a loan of £55 million to support the extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking Line to Barking Riverside, to unlock the delivery of up to 11,000 new homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent Cross
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government supports the London Borough of Barnet and GLA plans for the regeneration of Brent Cross which could deliver 7,500 homes, subject to a full business case.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebbsfleet
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is making the first £100m available to fund infrastructure and land remediation at Ebbsfleet, taking forward its commitment to build the first new garden city for almost 100 years, which will deliver up to 15,000 new homes. Improvements to the A2 Bean and Ebbsfleet Junctions will be delivered as part of the Highways Agency programme. The government will also undertake a review of transport provision for the Ebbsfleet area, including Crossrail, High Speed 1, Southern and Southeastern rail services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park redevelopment (Olympicopolis)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will invest £141m to support the London Legacy Development Corporation and Mayor of London’s plans to build a new higher education and cultural quarter at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roads Investment Strategy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is committing £15 billion between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to continue the transformation of the Strategic Road Network, including major projects for the A303, A1, A47 and A27.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossrail 2
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will provide £2 million between 2014-15 and 2015-16 to support the development of a comprehensive business case produced jointly by the
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department for Transport and Transport for London, to complete ahead of the next Spending Review. This will be combined with a full options appraisal of all potential major transport projects in London, including an extension of the Bakerloo Line to improve connectivity in south east London, and the devolution of South Eastern rail services to London.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low emission vehicle research and development
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is announcing up to £50 million between 2017-18 and 2019-20, to support innovation in manufacturing of ultra-low emission vehicles in the UK, based on a government contribution of £25 million for which it will seek match-funding from industry.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for ultra-low emission vehicles
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roads Investment Strategy sets aside £15 million between 2015-16 and 2020-21 for a national network of chargepoints for ultra-low emission vehicles on the Strategic Road Network. The government is also announcing further detail of three funds totalling £85 million to support ultra-low emission taxis, buses and cities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will provide an additional £10 million between 2017-18 and 2019-20 to increase ultra-low emission vehicles in London, in support of the ambition to introduce an Ultra-Low Emission Zone by 2025.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local highways maintenance grant
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has already announced that local highways maintenance funding will be increased, totalling £5.8 billion over the next six years, and can now announce how the formula grant will be broken down by region
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean Vehicle Technology fund
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will provide up to £4 million to extend the Clean Vehicle Technology fund in 2014-15 which funds road vehicle modification by Local Authorities in order to reduce air pollution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton Rail Station
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister the government will provide £44 million between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to build a new rail station at Chesterton, linked to Cambridge Science Park.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycle City Ambition grants
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 27 November, the government will provide £114 million between 2015-16 and 2017-18 to enable the continuation of the Cycle City Ambition scheme in the eight cities it already covers. This will provide capital funding for better cycle infrastructure such as segregated lanes and improved junctions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access for all
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will increase the funding for the Access for All scheme by £60 million between 2015-16 and 2018-19, improving platform access at around 20 stations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwich in Ninety
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government supports the key recommendations of the Great Eastern Main Line Task Force, including upgraded infrastructure and the latest Rolling Stock. Bidders for the next Anglia Franchise, which will start in Oct 2016, will be incentivised to submit plans for
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;achieving these recommendations for services to Norwich in 90 minutes and associated benefits along the Great Eastern Mainline.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East West Rail
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will consider the outputs of the Network Rail study into the East West Rail central section (Bedford to Cambridge) as part of the planning for Control Period 6 (2019-2024).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawlish rail services
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will support Network Rail in its work to improve the resilience of the railway at Dawlish. Additionally, it will ask Network Rail to examine wider issues surrounding connectivity to and within the South West peninsula. Specifically, Network Rail will consider alternatives to the current mainline route to the South West via Dawlish, including an alternative route via the north side of Dartmoor through Okehampton. This work will feed into Network Rail’s Initial Industry Plan for Control Period 6 (2019-2024).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bath City Centre Congestion Relief
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcomes the strategy put forward by Bath and North East Somerset Council and the West of England LEP to improve transport capacity East of Bath and reduce city centre congestion. The government will consider a business case, which will be developed by Bath and North East Somerset Council that assesses the viability of proposals including a park and ride, as well as a park and rail service, located to the East of Bath.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Transport Policy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government plans to lay the National Networks National Policy Statement before Parliament this month for consideration and a formal vote
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will publish proposals for Compulsory Purchase Reforms for consultation at Budget 2015 to make processes clearer, faster and fairer, with the aim of bringing forward more brownfield land for development
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will take forward measures to ensure that the principle of development need only be is established once.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will take steps to speed up section 106 negotiations, to reduce delays to the planning process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will keep speed of major decisions under review, with minimum performance thresholds increasing to 50% of major decisions made on time as performance improves.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is also announcing today a number of additional housing and planning measures:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicester
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will support a new garden town at Bicester to provide up to 13,000 new homes subject to value for money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public sector land: housing delivery
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will set ambitious targets for the release of public sector land between 2015 and 2020. Government is committed to releasing land with capacity for up to 150,000 homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordable housing
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will extend affordable housing capital investment to 2018-19 and 2019-20, to ensure that 275,000 new affordable homes can be delivered over the next Parliament.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared ownership
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will work with housing associations, lenders and the regulator to identify and lift barriers to extending shared ownership, including a consultation on options for streamlining the process for selling on shared ownership properties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Associations
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will consult on ways to increase the borrowing capacity of housing associations in relation to the valuation of properties transferred from local authorities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estates Regeneration
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget 14 announced a £150 million fund to kick start the regeneration of social housing estates through repayable loans. Following a bidding round, Grahame Park, Blackwall Reach, Aylesbury Estate and New Union Wharf regeneration projects have all now been approved for funding, subject to due diligence and contract negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small applications
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will publish new data on Local Authorities’ performance in meeting their statutory duty to process smaller planning applications within 8 weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small sites
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will work with industry and Local Authorities to test whether more can be done to support the approval of small sites in the planning system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the National Infrastructure Plan 2014 will be available on the gov.uk website and have been deposited in the libraries of both Houses.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will take forward development at Northstowe, to support accelerated delivery of up to 10,000 homes, and evaluate the feasibility and economic impact of using this model at a wider scale to support and accelerate housing supply
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barking Riverside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will agree a principal heads of terms agreement for a loan of £55 million to support the extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking Line to Barking Riverside, to unlock the delivery of up to 11,000 new homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent Cross
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government supports the London Borough of Barnet and GLA plans for the regeneration of Brent Cross which could deliver 7,500 homes, subject to a full business case.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebbsfleet
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is making the first £100m available to fund infrastructure and land remediation at Ebbsfleet, taking forward its commitment to build the first new garden city for almost 100 years, which will deliver up to 15,000 new homes. Improvements to the A2 Bean and Ebbsfleet Junctions will be delivered as part of the Highways Agency programme. The government will also undertake a review of transport provision for the Ebbsfleet area, including Crossrail, High Speed 1, Southern and Southeastern rail services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park redevelopment (Olympicopolis)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will invest £141m to support the London Legacy Development Corporation and Mayor of London’s plans to build a new higher education and cultural quarter at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roads Investment Strategy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is committing £15 billion between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to continue the transformation of the Strategic Road Network, including major projects for the A303, A1, A47 and A27.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossrail 2
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will provide £2 million between 2014-15 and 2015-16 to support the development of a comprehensive business case produced jointly by the
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department for Transport and Transport for London, to complete ahead of the next Spending Review. This will be combined with a full options appraisal of all potential major transport projects in London, including an extension of the Bakerloo Line to improve connectivity in south east London, and the devolution of South Eastern rail services to London.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low emission vehicle research and development
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government is announcing up to £50 million between 2017-18 and 2019-20, to support innovation in manufacturing of ultra-low emission vehicles in the UK, based on a government contribution of £25 million for which it will seek match-funding from industry.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for ultra-low emission vehicles
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roads Investment Strategy sets aside £15 million between 2015-16 and 2020-21 for a national network of chargepoints for ultra-low emission vehicles on the Strategic Road Network. The government is also announcing further detail of three funds totalling £85 million to support ultra-low emission taxis, buses and cities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will provide an additional £10 million between 2017-18 and 2019-20 to increase ultra-low emission vehicles in London, in support of the ambition to introduce an Ultra-Low Emission Zone by 2025.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local highways maintenance grant
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government has already announced that local highways maintenance funding will be increased, totalling £5.8 billion over the next six years, and can now announce how the formula grant will be broken down by region
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean Vehicle Technology fund
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will provide up to £4 million to extend the Clean Vehicle Technology fund in 2014-15 which funds road vehicle modification by Local Authorities in order to reduce air pollution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton Rail Station
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister the government will provide £44 million between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to build a new rail station at Chesterton, linked to Cambridge Science Park.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycle City Ambition grants
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 27 November, the government will provide £114 million between 2015-16 and 2017-18 to enable the continuation of the Cycle City Ambition scheme in the eight cities it already covers. This will provide capital funding for better cycle infrastructure such as segregated lanes and improved junctions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access for all
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will increase the funding for the Access for All scheme by £60 million between 2015-16 and 2018-19, improving platform access at around 20 stations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwich in Ninety
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government supports the key recommendations of the Great Eastern Main Line Task Force, including upgraded infrastructure and the latest Rolling Stock. Bidders for the next Anglia Franchise, which will start in Oct 2016, will be incentivised to submit plans for
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;achieving these recommendations for services to Norwich in 90 minutes and associated benefits along the Great Eastern Mainline.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East West Rail
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will consider the outputs of the Network Rail study into the East West Rail central section (Bedford to Cambridge) as part of the planning for Control Period 6 (2019-2024).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawlish rail services
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will support Network Rail in its work to improve the resilience of the railway at Dawlish. Additionally, it will ask Network Rail to examine wider issues surrounding connectivity to and within the South West peninsula. Specifically, Network Rail will consider alternatives to the current mainline route to the South West via Dawlish, including an alternative route via the north side of Dartmoor through Okehampton. This work will feed into Network Rail’s Initial Industry Plan for Control Period 6 (2019-2024).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bath City Centre Congestion Relief
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcomes the strategy put forward by Bath and North East Somerset Council and the West of England LEP to improve transport capacity East of Bath and reduce city centre congestion. The government will consider a business case, which will be developed by Bath and North East Somerset Council that assesses the viability of proposals including a park and ride, as well as a park and rail service, located to the East of Bath.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Transport Policy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government plans to lay the National Networks National Policy Statement before Parliament this month for consideration and a formal vote
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will publish proposals for Compulsory Purchase Reforms for consultation at Budget 2015 to make processes clearer, faster and fairer, with the aim of bringing forward more brownfield land for development
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will take forward measures to ensure that the principle of development need only be is established once.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will take steps to speed up section 106 negotiations, to reduce delays to the planning process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will keep speed of major decisions under review, with minimum performance thresholds increasing to 50% of major decisions made on time as performance improves.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is also announcing today a number of additional housing and planning measures:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicester
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will support a new garden town at Bicester to provide up to 13,000 new homes subject to value for money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public sector land: housing delivery
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will set ambitious targets for the release of public sector land between 2015 and 2020. Government is committed to releasing land with capacity for up to 150,000 homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordable housing
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will extend affordable housing capital investment to 2018-19 and 2019-20, to ensure that 275,000 new affordable homes can be delivered over the next Parliament.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared ownership
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will work with housing associations, lenders and the regulator to identify and lift barriers to extending shared ownership, including a consultation on options for streamlining the process for selling on shared ownership properties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing Associations
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will consult on ways to increase the borrowing capacity of housing associations in relation to the valuation of properties transferred from local authorities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estates Regeneration
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget 14 announced a £150 million fund to kick start the regeneration of social housing estates through repayable loans. Following a bidding round, Grahame Park, Blackwall Reach, Aylesbury Estate and New Union Wharf regeneration projects have all now been approved for funding, subject to due diligence and contract negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small applications
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will publish new data on Local Authorities’ performance in meeting their statutory duty to process smaller planning applications within 8 weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small sites
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will work with industry and Local Authorities to test whether more can be done to support the approval of small sites in the planning system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the National Infrastructure Plan 2014 will be available on the gov.uk website and have been deposited in the libraries of both Houses.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Eric Pickles) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to update hon. Members on the main items of business undertaken by my Department since the House rose for the Autumn Recess.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing house building and supporting the housing market
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official statistics of housing supply released on 13 November showed that the numbers of new homes in England has risen by 10% over the past year – the highest percentage increase in 12 years. Since 2010, the Government has delivered a net increase in housing supply of over 530,000 additional homes across England.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New figures also showed the numbers of repossessions are now at their lowest since records began in 2008, thanks to the Government’s long-term economic plan; our deficit reduction programme is keeping interest rates down and making mortgages more affordable. Figures published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders anticipate repossessions falling further in 2015 and 2016.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 18 November, my Department published a consultation paper on the next step to zero carbon homes. New homes built today are saving people around £200 on average on their energy bills compared to homes built before the 2010 General Election and cutting carbon emissions. From 2016, we are going even further by making all new build homes zero carbon, and we are now consulting on how to apply this to small house builders to ensure they continue to play their part in building much needed new homes, without them being priced out of the market.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating jobs through Enterprise Zone
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Zones are playing a vital role in driving forward England’s growing economy. On 12 November 2014, we announced that that the 24 Enterprise Zones have created an estimated 12,530 jobs, attracted 434 new businesses and generated over £2 billion worth of private investment since opening for business.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government-backed sites are providing top-class fiscal incentives and world-class infrastructure, promoting growth across a range of key industries, including the automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical, and renewable industry sectors – and also boosting the UK’s construction industry and wider supply chain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empowering local people with new community rights
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 11 November, we noted millions of people across England are now benefiting from the Coalition Government’s community rights programme; local
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;residents are coming together to protect pubs, libraries and leisure centres against sell off, creating neighbourhood plans to decide on new local development and deliver local jobs and improved local services. The total number of uses of the rights has now hit 3,000, with more than 1,500 much loved buildings, assets and green spaces listed and 1,200 neighbourhood plans well underway.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 14 November, we announced grants to six schemes to help them reopen to the public or transform their existing use enabling them to provide leisure, cultural and care facilities, create local jobs, and help build a stronger economy. Each scheme will receive between £130,000 and £440,000 funding which will pay for repairs and refurbishment for the new community use, and will help provide practical case studies for other communities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting fire safety
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 17 November, we launched a number of measures to boost the safety of e-cigarettes in response to increasing concerns over the number of fires caused by faulty charging units.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This included new consumer guidance as part of the Fire Kills campaign and Electrical Fire Safety Week. In addition, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has commissioned a number of local authority trading standards departments to investigate whether current e-cigarette safety information is sufficient and widely available enough to consumers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commemorating the Great War
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Department continues to support events to commemorate the centenary of the First World War to help promote united communities. Across the country, community groups including schools, libraries, museums and places of worship to community centres, football clubs and pubs are active participants in commemoration events researching their own local First World War heritage and holding musical recitals, such as the Last Post. Ministers supported a series of events to mark Armistice Day, which has a particular resonance this year given the Great War commemorations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am placing in the Library of the House copies of the press notices and documents associated with these announcements.

The total number of uses of the rights has now hit 3,000, with more than 1,500 much loved buildings, assets and green spaces listed and 1,200 neighbourhood plans well underway.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 14 November, we announced grants to six schemes to help them reopen to the public or transform their existing use enabling them to provide leisure, cultural and care facilities, create local jobs, and help build a stronger economy. Each scheme will receive between £130,000 and £440,000 funding which will pay for repairs and refurbishment for the new community use, and will help provide practical case studies for other communities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting fire safety
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 17 November, we launched a number of measures to boost the safety of e-cigarettes in response to increasing concerns over the number of fires caused by faulty charging units.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This included new consumer guidance as part of the Fire Kills campaign and Electrical Fire Safety Week. In addition, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has commissioned a number of local authority trading standards departments to investigate whether current e-cigarette safety information is sufficient and widely available enough to consumers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commemorating the Great War
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Department continues to support events to commemorate the centenary of the First World War to help promote united communities. Across the country, community groups including schools, libraries, museums and places of worship to community centres, football clubs and pubs are active participants in commemoration events researching their own local First World War heritage and holding musical recitals, such as the Last Post. Ministers supported a series of events to mark Armistice Day, which has a particular resonance this year given the Great War commemorations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am placing in the Library of the House copies of the press notices and documents associated with these announcements.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform the House that, subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary secondary legislation, I plan to implement important new provisions under Part 4 of the Immigration Act 2014 to tackle sham marriages and civil partnerships on Monday 2 March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 4 of the Act will give us a much stronger platform for effective, systematic action to disrupt and deter sham marriages and civil partnerships and prevent them gaining an immigration advantage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will extend the marriage and civil partnership notice period from 15 days to 28 days for all couples in England and Wales marrying following civil preliminaries or forming a civil partnership.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples involving a non-European Economic Area (non-EEA) national who wish to marry in the Church of England or the Church in Wales will be required to complete civil preliminaries and give notice at a register office.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2 March 2015 I also plan to implement under Part 4 of the Act a new referral and investigation scheme for proposed marriages and civil partnerships across the UK involving a non-EEA national who could benefit in immigration terms. All proposed marriages and civil partnerships involving a non-EEA national with limited or no immigration status in the UK, or who does not provide specified evidence that they are exempt from the scheme, will be referred to the Home Office. Where we have reasonable grounds to suspect a sham, we will be able to extend the notice period in these referred cases to 70 days in order to investigate and take appropriate enforcement or casework action where we establish a sham. A couple will be unable to get married or enter into a civil partnership on the basis of that notice if they do not comply with an investigation under the scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By extending the notice period and channelling to the Home Office all proposed marriages and civil partnerships which could bring an immigration benefit, the new system will give us much more time and information to identify and act against sham marriages and civil partnerships before they happen and, where they do go ahead, we will have the evidence we need on file to be able to refuse any subsequent immigration application in terms which will withstand appeal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The referral and investigation scheme will be extended to Scotland and to Northern Ireland from 2 March 2015, subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary secondary legislation. Those who give notice of marriage or civil partnership before 2 March 2015 will not be affected by the changes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitional arrangements will apply for couples where at least one party is resident overseas, who have made arrangements before 2 March 2015 for a marriage or civil partnership in England and Wales and who intend to give notice and get married or form a civil partnership in one visit on or after that date. Couples in this situation will be able to apply, at the time of giving their notice of marriage or civil partnership to the registration official, to have the notice period reduced to 15 days.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitional arrangements will also apply for couples involving a non-EEA national who before 2 March 2015 have been granted, or have applied for and are later granted, a common licence to marry in the Anglican Church in England and Wales. Couples in this situation will be able to marry on the basis of that licence and will not be required to complete civil preliminaries before marrying.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;As of 31 October 2014, the scheme has now issued payments totalling £990.5 million to 887,061 policyholders. The scheme has published a further progress report, which can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/equitable- life-payment-scheme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures are broken down as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;409,221 payments to individual investors have been issued totalling £555.2 million.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;37,732 initial payments to with-profits annuitants (WPAs) or their estates have been issued by the scheme, totalling £82 million. Subsequent annual payments totalling £187.5 million have also been issued to annuitants.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;440,108 payments totalling £165.8 million have been issued to those who bought their policy through their company pension scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now approximately 151,000 policyholders who are due a payment but where the scheme has not yet been able to trace or validate their address.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme has gone to significant lengths to trace eligible policyholders. It remains committed to tracing and paying as many eligible policyholders as possible, and will continue to consider all proportionate actions it can take to do this, including working with the Department for Work and Pensions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme encourages any policyholders who believe themselves to be eligible to call the scheme on: 0300 0200 150. The scheme can verify the identity of most policyholders on the telephone, which means any payment due can usually be received within two weeks.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;This statement updates the House on Government action to prepare for potential flooding this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting the country from flooding is a core DEFRA priority. This Government are investing £3.2 billion in flood defences in this Parliament, compared to £2.7 billion in the previous five years. This represents a real- terms increase and is helping us better protect over 165,000 properties since 2010. In addition, for the first time we have committed to six years of future capital spending to protect a further 300,000 properties and provide long-term planning for flood resilience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter 2013- 14
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter saw the wettest weather on record. There were record river flows, sea levels, wave heights and groundwater levels across widespread areas of the country. Although flood defences protected 1.4 million homes, 8,342 homes were flooded and thousands of people were affected by disruption to businesses, infrastructure, transport and utilities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then the Government have led a major flood recovery effort, including committing more than £560 million in recovery support funding. The result is that going into this winter every community is at least as well or better protected than it was last winter. In England, 844 flood defences owned by the Environment Agency, local authorities and others were damaged over the winter. All of the flood defences damaged last winter have been repaired, with either permanent or temporary repairs. DEFRA made an extra £270 million available to repair these defences. Permanent defences have been restored to over 200,000 properties. The Government have committed more than £20 million to help Somerset, which was particularly hard hit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somerset
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Somerset, the dredging of the Rivers Tone and Parrett was completed on time and on budget at the end of October. Somerset has been awarded a further £13.1 million through the local growth fund for more dredging; developing options for a Bridgwater Barrier; and a project to increase capacity of the River Sowy. Work is under way to raise key roads at Beer Wall and Muchelney. The Government are working with Somerset county council and others to establish a new rivers authority that will give local people the power to manage their flood risk.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military assistance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter highlighted the valuable contribution our armed forces can make. The Government have simplified the process by which local responders can request military help in emergencies, and local authorities were informed of the new arrangements in October.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving resilience
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are also taking action to improve the resilience of our transport, energy and water supply networks. For example, a review into resilience of transport networks was published in July and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Patrick McLoughlin)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;will today publish the Government’s response. DEFRA has also been working with water companies as they review their emergency plans to ensure water supplies are not affected by flooding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with communities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally, we are improving the way we work with communities to give them clarity on what works are being undertaken and the outcomes they will deliver. The Environment Agency has held local meetings across the country to explain its current maintenance programme, giving people the opportunity to contribute to and influence these programmes. We are also removing barriers for individuals and local groups to undertake work such as dredging watercourses through the river maintenance pilots scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with local authorities
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are working with local authorities to plan for flood risk through the development of local flood risk management strategies. We have identified those authorities where we feel work is most urgent, and we are strongly encouraging them to get strategies in place as soon as possible. We have also started work on a review of the 2010 Flood and Water Management Act, to check that flood risk is being properly managed at a local level.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National level preparedness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have improved our ability to respond to emergencies at a national level. For example, we will hold precautionary COBRA meetings if significant flooding is likely in advance of public holidays. This will help us ensure all organisations are fully prepared and ready to respond. The arrangements for making use of temporary flood defences and pumps have also been improved. On the recovery effort, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities (Eric Pickles) is updating the House today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood insurance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are taking action to ensure people at risk of flooding can protect themselves by securing affordable home insurance. The new Flood Re scheme will limit the amount that people pay for floods cover when it is introduced next year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising awareness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, we launched the national “Get Ready for Winter” campaign with the Met Office to encourage people and communities to think about preparing for winter. This month is the Environment Agency’s “flood awareness month”, and it has been explaining how to prepare and encouraging more people to join the 1 million who are already signed up to the flood warning service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing this Parliament—2010-11 to 2014-15—to the previous five years, investment in flood risk management has increased in real terms by 5%. Over the coming six-year period, we will be making record levels of investment (£2.3 billion) in capital flood defence projects. This will begin with £370 million in 2015-16 and then the same in real terms each year, rising to over £400 million in 2020-21. This is the first time that such a long-term settlement has been set out demonstrating our commitment to managing flood risk and providing communities with increased security.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This investment will deliver long-term value for money and reduce the risk of flooding to a further 300,000 households between April 2015 and March 2021,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;on top of the 165,000 protected during the current spending period. By the end of the decade, we will have provided a better level of protection to at least 465,000 households.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the exceptional weather conditions experienced last winter, in the large majority of cases our defences stood up well. They protected around 1.4 million properties and more than 600,000 acres of farmland from flooding. This underlines the importance of continuing our investment in flood defences. We have one of the best forecasting and warning systems in the world. We are determined to reduce the risk further and provide better protection for people’s homes, farms and businesses across the country. We have acted on the lessons from last winter and together with our local partners we are better prepared than ever before.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;Last winter saw some of the most severe weather on record, and thousands of homes and businesses were flooded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extension of flood recovery schemes to all of 2013-14
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government responded to these events by making relief available for those flooded, both from council tax and business rates, as well as by helping householders make their homes more resilient to future flooding. However, the Government are today recognising the hardship caused in other parts of England by flooding earlier in 2013-14 by announcing an extension of the following Government flood recovery support schemes: the Department for Communities and Local Government council tax and business rates relief schemes, the severe weather recovery fund (Communities Element); the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs repair and renew grant; and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills" business support scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make a real difference for those who suffered the appalling effects of flooding throughout the entirety of the 2013-14 financial year. My officials will be writing on behalf of the Government to all local authorities in England advising them of how to apply along with the terms and conditions of the various schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellwin consultation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter, to help local authorities deal with the immediate costs of the severe weather, the Government activated the Bellwin scheme of emergency financial assistance to local authorities, and in recognition of the unique scale of the flooding, made the terms of the scheme more generous. This included lowering the threshold above which the Government will compensate, and reimbursing 100% of local authorities’ costs above those lower thresholds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are today announcing a consultation on making those changes to the Bellwin Scheme permanent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparedness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will be making a full statement on winter preparedness. However, my Department has already done a great deal of work on this. We continue to engage with local government to consider how councils can build on and improve their emergency support outside normal business hours, including clearly publicising their emergency contact numbers; being a more visible part of the local response; and giving clear advice to residents and businesses on how to plan for emergencies. On 30 October DCLG published, jointly with the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, the “local authorities preparedness for civil emergencies: a good practice guide” to help local authorities ensure they are well-prepared to respond to a civil emergency in their local area. Ministerial colleagues will be meeting with leaders from a number of local authorities over the coming weeks to discuss preparedness to respond to winter weather and flooding in particular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery progress report
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also right that I update the House on the recovery progress from last winter’s severe weather events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are today publishing a flood recovery progress report updating on Government support and local authority activity over the past 11 months, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House. My Department has talked to local responders, including volunteers, businesses and communities to understand how the local flood response and recovery process was delivered in local areas; exploring with them lessons that we can all learn about the effects of last winter’s severe weather; and working with them to reduce the risk of damaging floods in future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, once again I would like to thank all those from local authorities, the emergency services, the armed forces, community and voluntary groups, the staff of the Environment Agency and transport workers who worked so hard throughout last winter, often in appalling conditions, to support and help people during the severe weather.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;Last winter saw some of the most severe weather on record, and thousands of homes and businesses were flooded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extension of flood recovery schemes to all of 2013-14
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government responded to these events by making relief available for those flooded, both from council tax and business rates, as well as by helping householders make their homes more resilient to future flooding. However, the Government are today recognising the hardship caused in other parts of England by flooding earlier in 2013-14 by announcing an extension of the following Government flood recovery support schemes: the Department for Communities and Local Government council tax and business rates relief schemes, the severe weather recovery fund (Communities Element); the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs repair and renew grant; and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills" business support scheme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make a real difference for those who suffered the appalling effects of flooding throughout the entirety of the 2013-14 financial year. My officials will be writing on behalf of the Government to all local authorities in England advising them of how to apply along with the terms and conditions of the various schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellwin consultation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter, to help local authorities deal with the immediate costs of the severe weather, the Government activated the Bellwin scheme of emergency financial assistance to local authorities, and in recognition of the unique scale of the flooding, made the terms of the scheme more generous. This included lowering the threshold above which the Government will compensate, and reimbursing 100% of local authorities’ costs above those lower thresholds.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are today announcing a consultation on making those changes to the Bellwin Scheme permanent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparedness
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will be making a full statement on winter preparedness. However, my Department has already done a great deal of work on this. We continue to engage with local government to consider how councils can build on and improve their emergency support outside normal business hours, including clearly publicising their emergency contact numbers; being a more visible part of the local response; and giving clear advice to residents and businesses on how to plan for emergencies. On 30 October DCLG published, jointly with the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, the “local authorities preparedness for civil emergencies: a good practice guide” to help local authorities ensure they are well-prepared to respond to a civil emergency in their local area. Ministerial colleagues will be meeting with leaders from a number of local authorities over the coming weeks to discuss preparedness to respond to winter weather and flooding in particular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recovery progress report
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also right that I update the House on the recovery progress from last winter’s severe weather events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are today publishing a flood recovery progress report updating on Government support and local authority activity over the past 11 months, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House. My Department has talked to local responders, including volunteers, businesses and communities to understand how the local flood response and recovery process was delivered in local areas; exploring with them lessons that we can all learn about the effects of last winter’s severe weather; and working with them to reduce the risk of damaging floods in future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, once again I would like to thank all those from local authorities, the emergency services, the armed forces, community and voluntary groups, the staff of the Environment Agency and transport workers who worked so hard throughout last winter, often in appalling conditions, to support and help people during the severe weather.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;Following the 2013-14 winter of sustained wet and windy weather, I invited Richard Brown OBE to chair a review of the resilience of our transport networks to extreme weather events. The review was published in July and today I am publishing the Government’s response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Brown’s review examined the resilience of our major transport modes, assessed lessons learned and put forward more than 60 recommendations to
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;improve resilience both in the short term and long term. The majority of recommendations quite rightly addressed the impacts of last winter’s weather which resulted in flooding, damage to transport assets and disruption to passenger services. The review did not look at the impacts of snow and ice as these were covered in the Quarmby review of 2010.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We accept the recommendations made in the review, and the response published today sets out in detail the actions being taken forward by Government and transport owners and operators to improve the resilience of our transport infrastructure and its operations. Good progress has been made since the review’s publication. Wherever possible actions have been put in place in advance of this winter, while other resilience activities have been planned for delivery as soon as practicable. Areas covered include asset management; communications; economics and funding; flooding; geotechnics; maintenance; supporting infrastructure; user behaviour; vegetation management and weather forecasting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there will always be vulnerabilities to our transport networks from extreme weather, the review has served to join up a lot of the existing work on resilience across transport modes and has prompted transport operators to take immediate action which should put them in an enhanced state of readiness to respond and recover from future severe weather events.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Department will monitor the progress of the resilience activities set out in the Government response, and will provide a supplementary report next year to provide an update on the delivery of the actions highlighted in the response.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the Government response can be found in the Libraries of both Houses and will be available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/review-of-the-resilience-of-the-transport-network-to-extreme-weather-events-expert-panel

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;Following the 2013-14 winter of sustained wet and windy weather, I invited Richard Brown OBE to chair a review of the resilience of our transport networks to extreme weather events. The review was published in July and today I am publishing the Government’s response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Brown’s review examined the resilience of our major transport modes, assessed lessons learned and put forward more than 60 recommendations to
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;improve resilience both in the short term and long term. The majority of recommendations quite rightly addressed the impacts of last winter’s weather which resulted in flooding, damage to transport assets and disruption to passenger services. The review did not look at the impacts of snow and ice as these were covered in the Quarmby review of 2010.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We accept the recommendations made in the review, and the response published today sets out in detail the actions being taken forward by Government and transport owners and operators to improve the resilience of our transport infrastructure and its operations.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing the start of the Triennial Review of UK Sport and Sport England. As executive non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPB), UK Sport and Sport England are required to undergo a Triennial Review. The joint UK Sport/Sport England review will have two principal aims, represented by two stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first stage will provide a robust challenge for the continuing need for the functions performed by both UK Sport and Sport England, and, if there is, whether some or all of these functions should be delivered by alternative delivery models or continued delivery by a Non- Departmental Public Body (NDPB).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is agreed that the functions of each should continue to be delivered by NDPBs, the second stage will review the organisational control and governance arrangements in place to ensure that they are compliant with the recognised principles of good corporate governance and delivering good value for money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The structure, efficiency and effectiveness of the two bodies will be considered as part of both stages. This will include an assessment of how well the two bodies work together, their progress against the conditions set in January 2013 on deciding not to merge them and the scope for further savings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings at both stages of the review will be examined by a challenge group.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details of the review and a survey seeking evidence about UK Sport and Sport England can be found on the DCMS website at https://www.gov.uk/government/news/triennial-review-of-uk-sport-and-sport-England

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;Last summer, we launched four 14-week long public consultations providing citizens and businesses across the UK and overseas with the opportunity to give their views on potential future Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and on the UK potentially seeking accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I will place a summary of responses received for each consultation exercise in the Library of the House. I will also publish these online on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public consultations attracted significant interest with 601,121 responses received across all four consultations. In view of the need to ensure that due consideration is given to each submission, we will publish the Government Response at a later date but before any formal trade negotiations begin, alongside an Outline Approach which sets out our high-level negotiation objectives and will explain how these have been informed by the consultation responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is committed to ensuring a transparent and inclusive trade policy, which supports the interests of consumers and businesses across the whole of the UK. The Government will continue to engage with the public, businesses and other stakeholders in order to understand their views and to help develop UK trade policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</str></arr>

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;Last summer, we launched four 14-week long public consultations providing citizens and businesses across the UK and overseas with the opportunity to give their views on potential future Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and on the UK potentially seeking accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I will place a summary of responses received for each consultation exercise in the Library of the House. I will also publish these online on GOV.UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public consultations attracted significant interest with 601,121 responses received across all four consultations. In view of the need to ensure that due consideration is given to each submission, we will publish the Government Response at a later date but before any formal trade negotiations begin, alongside an Outline Approach which sets out our high-level negotiation objectives and will explain how these have been informed by the consultation responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government is committed to ensuring a transparent and inclusive trade policy, which supports the interests of consumers and businesses across the whole of the UK. The Government will continue to engage with the public, businesses and other stakeholders in order to understand their views and to help develop UK trade policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</str></arr>

To align with this expectation, UKEF will be updating its definitions to clarify UKEF’s ability to support intangible assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the consultation response will be placed in the libraries of the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</str></arr>

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Government have made significant progress in putting the welfare state on a sustainable footi</str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Government have made significant progress in putting the welfare state on a sustainable footing—undertaking major reforms to benefits and pensions, in order to restore fairness and restore public finances at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this decisive action, at Budget 2014, the Government took the unprecedented step of introducing a cap on welfare. Today, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has confirmed that the Government are on track to meet the welfare cap commitment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more, the OBR now forecasts welfare spending outside the cap to be £2.3 billion a year lower on average over the next four years, compared to Budget 2014—contributing to a reduction in the overall welfare spending forecast in each and every year of the cap forecast.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a marked improvement in exercising discipline over welfare spending. Spending in scope of the welfare cap accounts for £1 in every £6 spent by the Government. Yet in spite of this, it had never previously been subject to firm controls and was allowed to increase by £48 billion under the last Government, up from £70 billion to £118 billion. This was within an overall welfare bill that increased by 60% in real terms, rising even before the recession.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Government’s welfare reforms are set to save nearly £50 billion over this Parliament. But for these vital changes, welfare spending was set to be that much higher still.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, by actively managing welfare spending, we have halted the damaging trend of welfare spending escalating out of control. Overall welfare spending has been falling as a proportion of GDP since 2012, and last year fell in real terms for the first time in 16 years —even while spending on pensioners rose. This year,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;working age welfare spending is forecast to be £3 billion lower in real terms than in 2009-10. Testament to the success of the Government’s long-term economic plan, there have been significant falls in spending on unemployment, down over £2 billion since the recession; and on out-of-work benefits, back to pre-recession levels by 2015-16.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the OBR’s first assessment of the welfare cap shows that the Government are forecast to meet the welfare cap commitment, in each of the four years of the forecast period from 2015-16 to 2018-19. The Government are living within the rules of the cap and there has been no breach.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detail of that assessment is set out in full in the OBR’s “Economic and Fiscal Outlook December 2014”. This explains that the use of the margin in 2015-16 and 2016-17 is due to forecast reasons, not policy changes— the margin exists to allow for such fluctuations in the forecast. As the OBR has set out in the economic and fiscal outlook, its forecast for the volume of work capability assessments for employment and support allowance has been adjusted downward, and the forecast of the number of people who are likely to receive PIP has been adjusted upward. These, alongside other changes to the incapacity and disability benefit forecasts, have increased the forecast and result in use of the margin in 2015-16 and 2016-17, then falling below the margin in 2017-18 and 2018-19. However, overall, compared to its forecasts at Budget 2014, the OBR has revised welfare spending down by £1.3 billion a year on average up to 2018-19.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these reforms are set to save money and deliver efficiencies in the long term. That much is shown by excess spending continually falling over the four-year period, bringing spending below the level of the welfare cap in 2017-18 and 2018-19.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, this reflects the full effect of the Government’s action to bring spending back under control, arresting the growth that was once left to escalate. In future years, the aim must be to continue to exercise discipline and rigour in managing welfare spending—as this Government have committed to do.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Government have made significant progress in putting the welfare state on a sustainable footing—undertaking major reforms to benefits and pensions, in order to restore fairness and restore public finances at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this decisive action, at Budget 2014, the Government took the unprecedented step of introducing a cap on welfare. Today, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has confirmed that the Government are on track to meet the welfare cap commitment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more, the OBR now forecasts welfare spending outside the cap to be £2.3 billion a year lower on average over the next four years, compared to Budget 2014—contributing to a reduction in the overall welfare spending forecast in each and every year of the cap forecast.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a marked improvement in exercising discipline over welfare spending. Spending in scope of the welfare cap accounts for £1 in every £6 spent by the Government. Yet in spite of this, it had never previously been subject to firm controls and was allowed to increase by £48 billion under the last Government, up from £70 billion to £118 billion. This was within an overall welfare bill that increased by 60% in real terms, rising even before the recession.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Government’s welfare reforms are set to save nearly £50 billion over this Parliament. But for these vital changes, welfare spending was set to be that much higher still.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, by actively managing welfare spending, we have halted the damaging trend of welfare spending escalating out of control. Overall welfare spending has been falling as a proportion of GDP since 2012, and last year fell in real terms for the first time in 16 years —even while spending on pensioners rose. This year,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;working age welfare spending is forecast to be £3 billion lower in real terms than in 2009-10. Testament to the success of the Government’s long-term economic plan, there have been significant falls in spending on unemployment, down over £2 billion since the recession; and on out-of-work benefits, back to pre-recession levels by 2015-16.

The Government are living within the rules of the cap and there has been no breach.

As part of the Government’s continuing drive for efficiency and effectiveness, all departments are required to review their arms length bodies at least once in every three year review cycle to challenge whether the functions they perform are still necessary and if so whether it is still appropriate for them to be delivered in the same way. The review of the Social Security Advisory Committee will look at the Committee’s functions and whether it needs to continue to exist. If the review determines that the Committee should continue, it will go on to examine the potential for delivering more effectively and efficiently and the corporate governance mechanisms.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;In 2012, we published “Social Justice: transforming lives”, a landmark document setting out a new vision for supporting the most disadvantaged families and individuals across the UK. The strategy outlined how family breakdown, low educational attainment, worklessness, problem debt, and addiction combine to cause the entrenched poverty affecting many of our communities, highlighting the complexity of the issues that many people face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge, the strategy signalled that a new approach was needed— putting early intervention first, while tackling the root causes of poverty to give those experiencing disadvantage a meaningful second chance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I wish to inform the House that later today I am laying the Command Paper “Social Justice: transforming lives—progress report”, which shows what this Government have achieved in turning that vision into a reality, but also renews our commitment to this important agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 12 months, we have continued the cultural change needed in order to achieve our aims, spanning not only families and individuals, but also public services and the way the Government fund them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As today’s progress report sets out, delivering this aim has required a complete shift in how the Government tackle social problems: an unrelenting focus on preventing problems arising in the first place; giving people the support they need to make transformational changes to their own lives when problems arise; and spearheading new multi-agency, outcome focused approaches in order to address problems in the round.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The achievements set out in this report show how much can change in two years, and what this change means to individuals. We have made substantial progress against the commitments set out in the original “Social Justice: transforming lives” document, but we have not stopped there, and this report outlines what further action is required and how we should keep up the pressure on what we have created, which carries the profound theme of making meaningful life changes to the most vulnerable in our society.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By restating our commitment to transforming lives, and continuing to drive change in Government, at a local level and across the voluntary sector, in how we help families and individuals in need, we will make social justice a reality for everyone in the United Kingdom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us continue to work together to build on this promising work. Our aim is not just about social justice in this Parliament; it is about social justice for years to come.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;In 2012, we published “Social Justice: transforming lives”, a landmark document setting out a new vision for supporting the most disadvantaged families and individuals across the UK. The strategy outlined how family breakdown, low educational attainment, worklessness, problem debt, and addiction combine to cause the entrenched poverty affecting many of our communities, highlighting the complexity of the issues that many people face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet this challenge, the strategy signalled that a new approach was needed— putting early intervention first, while tackling the root causes of poverty to give those experiencing disadvantage a meaningful second chance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, I wish to inform the House that later today I am laying the Command Paper “Social Justice: transforming lives—progress report”, which shows what this Government have achieved in turning that vision into a reality, but also renews our commitment to this important agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 12 months, we have continued the cultural change needed in order to achieve our aims, spanning not only families and individuals, but also public services and the way the Government fund them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As today’s progress report sets out, delivering this aim has required a complete shift in how the Government tackle social problems: an unrelenting focus on preventing problems arising in the first place; giving people the support they need to make transformational changes to their own lives when problems arise; and spearheading new multi-agency, outcome focused approaches in order to address problems in the round.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The achievements set out in this report show how much can change in two years, and what this change means to individuals. We have made substantial progress against the commitments set out in the original “Social Justice: transforming lives” document, but we have not stopped there, and this report outlines what further action is required and how we should keep up the pressure on what we have created, which carries the profound theme of making meaningful life changes to the most vulnerable in our society.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By restating our commitment to transforming lives, and continuing to drive change in Government, at a local level and across the voluntary sector, in how we help families and individuals in need, we will make social justice a reality for everyone in the United Kingdom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us continue to work together to build on this promising work. Our aim is not just about social justice in this Parliament; it is about social justice for years to come.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The European Competitiveness Council will take place on Thursday 4th December and Friday 5th December. Baroness Neville-Rolfe will represent the UK on day one (industry and internal market). UK representation for the second day of the Council is to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal market and industry substantive agenda items are: proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on package travel and assisted travel arrangements, proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cableway installations and proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on personal protective equipment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the travel package proposal is to update consumer protection legislation as it applies to holiday arrangements. This is to reflect the impact of technological developments facilitated by the internet, and the emergence of low cost airlines, since 1990.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cableway proposal seeks to address some of the difficulties that have been experienced by some Member States in implementing the existing Cableways Directive. It provides clarification on the scope of the cableway installations designed for transport and leisure purposes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personal protective proposal is to replace the existing Personal Protective Equipment Directive, which regulates the placing of personal protective equipment (PPE) on the EU market, by laying down the health and safety requirements to which it must conform.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be five non-legislative agenda items discussed at the Council: a presentation on industrial competitiveness – an agenda for jobs and growth, a policy debate on enhancing the single market in all its dimensions, draft council conclusions on smart regulation, draft council conclusions on strengthening tourism by leveraging Europe’s cultural, natural and maritime heritage and draft Council conclusions on customs risk management.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be a number of non-legislative agenda items discussed on the second day of the Council: a policy debate on Science with and for Society draft Council conclusions on Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA), a European Research Area (ERA) Progress Report 2014; and Research and Innovation as sources of Renewed Growth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, on the Space element of the Council there will be an exchange of views on the competitiveness of the European space sector as a key driver for the European economy. We will take this opportunity to set out UK views and Council conclusions on underpinning the European space renaissance: orientations and future challenges.

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;The EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) took place in Brussels on 21 November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I repres</str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) took place in Brussels on 21 November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I represented the UK on all the issues discussed at the meeting. A summary of those discussions follows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU’s High Representative Vice President addressed the Council to say she hoped to participate as much as possible in future Trade FACs in order to co-ordinate trade and foreign policy, emphasising among other things the political aspects of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) implementation with the eastern neighbourhood.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two legislative items were discussed:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of the European Union against dumped imports.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency and the Commission expressed disappointment that no compromise has been found between Member States on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, along with the other trade liberals, reiterated that no package could be considered balanced that restricted the use of the Lesser Duty Rule (LDR). I reminded the Council that EU producers and consumers had been saved millions of euros thanks to the LDR, and limiting it could harm EU growth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Member States argued that removing the LDR in certain circumstances would create a level playing field. Other Member States took positions between these. The Presidency concluded more work was needed on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Procurement Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency took stock of progress on the International Procurement Instrument (intended to permit the EU to close a procurement market where a non-EU country’s procurement market was similarly closed). The Presidency highlighted its compromise proposals, which reflected the European Parliament’s amendments, and reiterated that access to the EU’s public procurement market needed to be used as leverage in negotiations with third countries. The Presidency invited the Commission and European Parliament to consider further. Trade Commissioner Malmström spoke in support of the Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Legislative items:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTO – Doha Development Agenda (DDA).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other Member States I warmly supported the Commission’s report that the DDA work programme implementing the outcome of the December 2013 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali seemed set to get back on track, following the recent agreement between the US and India on how to unblock the stalemate relating to food security in the proposed Trade Facilitation Agreement. Along with other Member States, I warmly supported.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP – the EU-US Free Trade Agreement).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency (Calenda) emphasised the economic and systemic importance of the deal. The aim remained to conclude an ambitious agreement rapidly, ahead
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of a change in US administration. TTIP was also a way to unlock growth without spending taxpayers’ money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade Commissioner Malmström reiterated her transparency announcement of earlier in the week, that access to TTIP texts would be expanded and TTIP negotiating proposals would be made public. Busting myths was agreed as important. For example, it was agreed that TTIP would not threaten national public services, such as the NHS, as policy over such public services would remain a matter for member states.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Member States agreed on the importance of the deal. I urged the Commission to use the window of opportunity before the end of the President Obama Administration, and welcomed plans for increased transparency.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU-Japan and EU-Vietnam.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commissioner Malmström presented the state-of-play in the negotiations with Japan. The FTA, worth potentially over €40bn (£31bn) to the EU in the long term, was a high priority. Discussions had been challenging recently but successful and would now speed up. Both sides wanted to reach political agreement in 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the EU-Vietnam FTA, the Commissioner reported that negotiations were going well and remained confident about conclusion in spring 2015.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) took place in Brussels on 21 November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I represented the UK on all the issues discussed at the meeting. A summary of those discussions follows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU’s High Representative Vice President addressed the Council to say she hoped to participate as much as possible in future Trade FACs in order to co-ordinate trade and foreign policy, emphasising among other things the political aspects of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) implementation with the eastern neighbourhood.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two legislative items were discussed:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of the European Union against dumped imports.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency and the Commission expressed disappointment that no compromise has been found between Member States on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, along with the other trade liberals, reiterated that no package could be considered balanced that restricted the use of the Lesser Duty Rule (LDR). I reminded the Council that EU producers and consumers had been saved millions of euros thanks to the LDR, and limiting it could harm EU growth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Member States argued that removing the LDR in certain circumstances would create a level playing field. Other Member States took positions between these. The Presidency concluded more work was needed on this file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Procurement Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency took stock of progress on the International Procurement Instrument (intended to permit the EU to close a procurement market where a non-EU country’s procurement market was similarly closed). The Presidency highlighted its compromise proposals, which reflected the European Parliament’s amendments, and reiterated that access to the EU’s public procurement market needed to be used as leverage in negotiations with third countries. The Presidency invited the Commission and European Parliament to consider further. Trade Commissioner Malmström spoke in support of the Instrument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Legislative items:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTO – Doha Development Agenda (DDA).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with other Member States I warmly supported the Commission’s report that the DDA work programme implementing the outcome of the December 2013 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali seemed set to get back on track, following the recent agreement between the US and India on how to unblock the stalemate relating to food security in the proposed Trade Facilitation Agreement. Along with other Member States, I warmly supported.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP – the EU-US Free Trade Agreement).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Presidency (Calenda) emphasised the economic and systemic importance of the deal. The aim remained to conclude an ambitious agreement rapidly, ahead

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 required Ministers across Government to undertake a review of powers of entry. The Act required Ministers who are members of the Cabinet with responsibility for powers of entry to examine their powers and to consider whether they are still necessary, proportionate and contain sufficient safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers of each Department have now concluded their reviews and prepared reports which will be laid before Parliament today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reports show that a total of 1,237 powers of entry have been subject to review. Government is proposing a significant reduction in the overall number of powers which will leave a total of 912. Government has also ensured that, where necessary, remaining powers will have additional safeguards added via legislation to ensure appropriate use of the powers. The number of powers for which it is proposed to add safeguards is 231.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 required Ministers across Government to undertake a review of powers of entry. The Act required Ministers who are members of the Cabinet with responsibility for powers of entry to examine their powers and to consider whether they are still necessary, proportionate and contain sufficient safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers of each Department have now concluded their reviews and prepared reports which will be laid before Parliament today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reports show that a total of 1,237 powers of entry have been subject to review. Government is proposing a significant reduction in the overall number of powers which will leave a total of 912. Government has also ensured that, where necessary, remaining powers will have additional safeguards added via legislation to ensure appropriate use of the powers. The number of powers for which it is proposed to add safeguards is 231.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The EU Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) will take place in Brussels on 21 November 2014. I will represent the UK on all the issues on the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be two substantive items on the agenda:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council amending European Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;how to protect the European Union against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. (Dumped goods are those imported into the European Union at unfairly low prices which cause significant harm to European competitors); and European Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protecting European companies against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission proposed a Trade Defence (anti-dumping, anti-subsidy) Instruments Modernisation package in April 2013. This comprises regulatory and non-regulatory proposals, on issues such as the period of notice of imposition of trade defence measures, reimbursement of duties paid by importers when measures are not renewed, and increased assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council making it easier for non-EU goods and services to enter the European Union’s internal market in public procurement, and procedures supporting negotiations to make it easier for European Union goods and services to enter the public procurement markets of non-EU countries. This is an orientation debate on a proposal that aims to restrict the access of non-EU countries to our domestic procurement markets where they do not open their markets to ours.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also expect updates or discussions on the following non-legislative items:-
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The latest state of play with the WTO’s Doha Development Agenda trade round (which aims to improve the trading prospects of all countries but particularly developing countries) in view of the agreement reached between the US and India on the Decision on stockpiling for food security purposes; and the latest state of play on the implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (streamlining of customs and trade procedures) agreed in Bali in December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- EU-US TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) Free Trade Agreement negotiations aimed at reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade between the EU and the US;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Negotiations on an EU Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan aimed at reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade between the EU and Japan;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Negotiations on an EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement aimed at reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade between the EU and Vietnam.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;On 22 July, I informed the House that I intended to reform elements of the police disciplinary system to improve transparency and justice and to strengthen protections for police whistleblowers. Today I am launching a six-week public consultation on these measures. Subject to the consultations I intend to implement these measures before the end of this Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integrity of the men and women who work in the police service of England and Wales is critical to public trust in policing. Real or perceived misconduct or corruption dents that trust and makes policing by consent more difficult. The vast majority of police officers behave appropriately and conscientiously, which makes it even more important to root out misconduct and malpractice and hold those responsible to account.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to ensure that the systems and processes that deal with misconduct by police officers are robust, independent and transparent to the public. In July I commissioned Major-General Chip Chapman to review the police disciplinary system. His report has been completed and I will consult on his recommendations for wide-ranging reform shortly. That consultation will also include proposals to fundamentally reform the police complaints system and further protections for police whistleblowers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation I am launching today focuses on specific reforms that can be made in the short term that will have a significant impact in making the current system more robust, independent and transparent until such point when more fundamental reforms can be implemented.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve justice, I am consulting on a power for disciplinary hearing panels to remove or adjust the compensation payments due to chief officers on termination of their appointment where a disciplinary finding is made against them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To introduce greater independence into the way police disciplinary hearings are conducted and ensure judgements are legally sound, I am consulting on the introduction of legally qualified chairs to conduct police disciplinary hearings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To strengthen protections for police whistleblowers and ensure they can come forward with confidence, I am consulting on proposals to ensure whistleblowers will not be subject to disciplinary action for taking the necessary steps to report a concern and that any reprisals against them will be taken seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to improve transparency and accountability to the public and ensure that the robust response that the police take to misconduct is both visible and open to public scrutiny, I am consulting on holding police disciplinary hearings and appeals in public.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that all those with an interest in these matters will respond to the consultation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the consultation document will be placed in the Library of the House.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;On 22 July, I informed the House that I intended to reform elements of the police disciplinary system to improve transparency and justice and to strengthen protections for police whistleblowers. Today I am launching a six-week public consultation on these measures. Subject to the consultations I intend to implement these measures before the end of this Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integrity of the men and women who work in the police service of England and Wales is critical to public trust in policing. Real or perceived misconduct or corruption dents that trust and makes policing by consent more difficult. The vast majority of police officers behave appropriately and conscientiously, which makes it even more important to root out misconduct and malpractice and hold those responsible to account.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to ensure that the systems and processes that deal with misconduct by police officers are robust, independent and transparent to the public. In July I commissioned Major-General Chip Chapman to review the police disciplinary system. His report has been completed and I will consult on his recommendations for wide-ranging reform shortly. That consultation will also include proposals to fundamentally reform the police complaints system and further protections for police whistleblowers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation I am launching today focuses on specific reforms that can be made in the short term that will have a significant impact in making the current system more robust, independent and transparent until such point when more fundamental reforms can be implemented.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve justice, I am consulting on a power for disciplinary hearing panels to remove or adjust the compensation payments due to chief officers on termination of their appointment where a disciplinary finding is made against them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To introduce greater independence into the way police disciplinary hearings are conducted and ensure judgements are legally sound, I am consulting on the introduction of legally qualified chairs to conduct police disciplinary hearings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To strengthen protections for police whistleblowers and ensure they can come forward with confidence, I am consulting on proposals to ensure whistleblowers will not be subject to disciplinary action for taking the necessary steps to report a concern and that any reprisals against them will be taken seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to improve transparency and accountability to the public and ensure that the robust response that the police take to misconduct is both visible and open to public scrutiny, I am consulting on holding police disciplinary hearings and appeals in public.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that all those with an interest in these matters will respond to the consultation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the consultation document will be placed in the Library of the House.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The informal G6 group of Ministers of the Interior from the six largest European Union countries held its most recent meeting in Paris on 6 November 2014. Representatives of the United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the European Commission attended for part of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit was chaired by the French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and I represented the United Kingdom. The other participating states were represented by Jorge Fernandez Diaz (Spain), Teresa Piotrowska (Poland), Angelino Alfano (Italy), and Thomas de Maiziere (Germany). The USA was represented by Alejandro Mayorkas (Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security) and Eric Holder (US Attorney-General). The European Commission was represented by Dimitris Avramopoulos (Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship) and the European Union by Gilles de Kerchove (EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator). In addition to the usual attendees Efkan Ala (Turkey) and Steven Blaney (Canada) were present.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first session of the day was on priority issues for the next European Parliament. The discussion touched on border checks and the importance of balancing security and liberty but focused mainly on the passenger name record (PNR) directive. Delegates agreed on the importance of making quick progress to conclude the PNR directive.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lunchtime discussion was on migration flows. The group collectively agreed the importance of implementing the JHA Council conclusions of 10 October covering action in co-operation with third countries; reinforced management of external borders and Frontex; and action at member states’ level-reception and fingerprinting. The European Commissioner (Avramopoulos) said the implementation of the conclusions would be a priority for the Commission. Conversation in this session also touched on the importance of securing borders and the need for fingerprinting asylum seekers at their point of entry to the EU.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first session after lunch was titled “Radicalisation via the Internet”. Delegates noted the positive progress that had been made following discussions with internet service providers (ISP) and agreed the need for joint working.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final session of the day was on the issue of foreign fighters. A number of countries reported developments and M. Cazeneuve (France) noted their new legislation which enables them to ban people from leaving the country if they thought they were involved in terrorism by way of withdrawal of their passport and ID card. He concluded by suggesting that all countries would benefit from a power to revoke passports and that it was vital that information sharing be improved. He noted that there must be progress on PNR and border checks and strengthening of co-operation with Turkey.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my interventions, I supported the need for an EU PNR directive which included PNR on intra-EU journeys, supported the JHA Council conclusions of 10 October on future migration policies and set out the action which the UK has taken to tackle the problem of returning foreign fighters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was announced at the meeting that the next G6 will take place in Dresden in Germany on 1 and 2 June 2015.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council is due to be held on 4 and 5 December in Brussels. The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), and I will attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice day on 4 December will begin with the Italian presidency seeking a partial general approach on chapter IX of the proposal for a general data protection regulation. This deals with personal data processing for statistical, scientific and medical research purposes as well as provisions dealing with freedom of expression, employment and social protection. The presidency is also looking to secure a partial general approach on the issue of public sector flexibility within the instrument. Although progress has been made in improving some aspects of the text, the Government are against the use of partial general approaches with regard to this dossier, given the amount of technical detail on which disagreement remains.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, they will hold an orientation debate on the regulatory one-stop shop which is intended to clarify in which member state regulatory decision-making should take place where there is a cross-border element to the processing of personal data.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency will also provide a state of play update on the proposal for a data protection directive, covering the processing of personal data in the investigation and detection of crime. At this stage, it is not looking to secure any agreement as there has been more limited progress than is the case on the proposed general data protection regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be an orientation debate on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) proposal. The UK does not and will not participate in the EPPO. Debate will centre on the EPPO’s nomination and appointment procedures and how best to deliver independence within the “college” structure. While the UK plays an active role in the negotiations as a non-participating member state, to shape and protect our position, we do not anticipate a need to intervene on these internal matters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency will present a partial general approach in relation to the Commission’s proposal to reform Eurojust, covering Chapters I-III and V-IX—omitting the chapter on data protection—of the proposal with all references to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) removed. Given that Eurojust’s relationship with the EPPO is not covered in the revised text, it is impossible to take a definitive view on items such as governance arrangements. However, the presidency text provided is broadly positive from a UK perspective. One of our key concerns was to ensure that member states are not obliged to give additional powers to their national members. The presidency text is much improved in this regard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency will be aiming for a general approach on the directive on presumption of innocence. The UK has not opted in to this proposal though monitors negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by a state of play debate on the directive on legal aid; again the UK has not opted in to this proposal. The Council also seeks an update on the state of play for the draft directive on the fight against fraud by means of criminal law following the European Parliament’s first reading position of April 2014; the Council continues to discuss the content of the directive ahead of trilogues.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, there will be a political agreement on the proposal for a revised regulation on insolvency proceedings. This represents the end of negotiations which began in January 2013 following a proposal from the Commission to modernise the existing regulation, particularly to expand its scope to ensure businesses in the EU are rescued where possible and jobs preserved. The Council is being asked to reach political agreement on the text with a view to adoption in 2015. The UK Government support this revision.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be orientation guidelines on the regulation on promoting the free movement of citizens and businesses by simplifying the acceptance of certain public documents in the EU. This measure aims to abolish the process of “legalisation” of certain public documents. Legalisation is the formality to confirm the authenticity of an official signature or seal. The regulation also proposes establishing EU multilingual forms. The Government support the principle of reducing red tape and costs and welcome recent amendments to both parts of the proposal which have limited the list of documents in scope to core civil status documents, such as birth, death and marriage certificates. They also welcome ongoing discussions to replace the proposed multilingual forms with simple translations of the original national documents rather than creating translated standalone forms with their own evidential value.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency hopes to obtain a general approach to amend the European small claims regulation. From a UK perspective the negotiations have been successful in achieving our main objectives, including returning to the current definition of what constitutes a cross-border case and ensuring that no arbitrary cap on court fees is imposed on member states. The Government would have preferred a higher threshold for a small claim than €4,000 but understand that a compromise had to be found between the different positions of the member states.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency is to provide a state of play report on the negotiations of the proposals on matrimonial property and the property consequences of registered partnerships. This is likely to state that while most technical issues have been finalised agreement on the proposals has not yet proved possible because of political concerns from some member states regarding the status of same-sex relationships. As these proposals will be decided under the special legislative procedure for family measures, agreement must be obtained by unanimity. The UK has not opted in to either proposal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under AOB, there will be an update from the presidency on the outcome of proceedings of the EU-US justice and home affairs ministerial meeting which took place in Washington DC on 12-13 November 2014. Finally the Latvian delegation will give a presentation on their incoming presidency programme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interior session on 5 December will begin in mixed committee with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland—non-EU Schengen states. We expect the Council to focus on the implementation of October’s JHA Council conclusions on the response to migratory pressures, in particular those from the Mediterranean. The UK will press for full implementation of the conclusions, in particular supporting further action in key countries of origin and transit, offering further support for the new Frontex operation in the Mediterranean, and pressing for further efforts to ensure member states are meeting their responsibilities in the area of asylum and illegal migration.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission will present the latest biannual report on the functioning of the Schengen area, and Council will be given the opportunity to discuss its content. Although the UK does not participate in the border and visa elements of the Schengen acquis, the Government maintain a strong interest given the effect of illegal migration transiting the Schengen area on UK borders. We will call for the EU to consider the role that Schengen visa liberalisation with non-EU member states can play in creating opportunities for immigration abuse, including the abuse of free movement rights by non-EU nationals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers will be invited to note a report highlighting the achievements of 15 years of Schengen evaluations under the Council’s management. Council conclusions will then be discussed, to allow the continuation of the relevant evaluation working group beyond 27 November. This will retain Schengen evaluation expertise within the Council structure and assist Ministers in effective delivery of the new Schengen evaluation mechanism. The UK supports this move.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency currently plans a debate on Bulgarian and Romanian accession to Schengen, at the request of Romania and Bulgaria, who are seeking to finalise their accession to the border aspects of the Schengen acquis and then lower border controls with their EU neighbours. While the Italian presidency would like to see this issue resolved at Council, accession remains blocked by a minority of member states. The presidency may well withdraw it from the agenda—as it did in October. If the debate goes ahead, Bulgaria and Romania are likely to express their frustration. As this currently concerns only borders elements of Schengen, the UK does not have a vote.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over lunch on the interior day there will be an update on passenger name records (PNR). The Council will consider how to proceed on PNR given the recent decision
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;by the European Parliament to refer the EU Canada PNR agreement to the European Court of Justice. It is possible the LIBE Committee will use the referral to further delay progress on the draft PNR directive. The UK supports speedy adoption of the PNR directive, but we are clear that it should provide for intra-EEA PNR.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council will return to the issue of foreign fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq. Member states will be invited to discuss a number of issues based on a presidency paper, as called for at the June European Council. The Council will also be asked to adopt the guidelines which accompany the EU strategy for combating radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism, following the adoption of the updated strategy earlier this year. The UK supports the guidelines and has taken an active role in negotiations at working level, drawing on the UK’s experience of Prevent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under AOB, there will be an update from the presidency on the outcome of proceedings of the EU-US justice and home affairs ministerial meeting which took place in Washington DC on 12-13 November 2014.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council is due to be held on 4 and 5 December in Brussels. The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), and I will attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice day on 4 December will begin with the Italian presidency seeking a partial general approach on chapter IX of the proposal for a general data protection regulation. This deals with personal data processing for statistical, scientific and medical research purposes as well as provisions dealing with freedom of expression, employment and social protection. The presidency is also looking to secure a partial general approach on the issue of public sector flexibility within the instrument. Although progress has been made in improving some aspects of the text, the Government are against the use of partial general approaches with regard to this dossier, given the amount of technical detail on which disagreement remains.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, they will hold an orientation debate on the regulatory one-stop shop which is intended to clarify in which member state regulatory decision-making should take place where there is a cross-border element to the processing of personal data.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency will also provide a state of play update on the proposal for a data protection directive, covering the processing of personal data in the investigation and detection of crime. At this stage, it is not looking to secure any agreement as there has been more limited progress than is the case on the proposed general data protection regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be an orientation debate on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) proposal. The UK does not and will not participate in the EPPO. Debate will centre on the EPPO’s nomination and appointment procedures and how best to deliver independence within the “college” structure. While the UK plays an active role in the negotiations as a non-participating member state, to shape and protect our position, we do not anticipate a need to intervene on these internal matters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency will present a partial general approach in relation to the Commission’s proposal to reform Eurojust, covering Chapters I-III and V-IX—omitting the chapter on data protection—of the proposal with all references to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) removed. Given that Eurojust’s relationship with the EPPO is not covered in the revised text, it is impossible to take a definitive view on items such as governance arrangements. However, the presidency text provided is broadly positive from a UK perspective. One of our key concerns was to ensure that member states are not obliged to give additional powers to their national members. The presidency text is much improved in this regard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency will be aiming for a general approach on the directive on presumption of innocence. The UK has not opted in to this proposal though monitors negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by a state of play debate on the directive on legal aid; again the UK has not opted in to this proposal. The Council also seeks an update on the state of play for the draft directive on the fight against fraud by means of criminal law following the European Parliament’s first reading position of April 2014; the Council continues to discuss the content of the directive ahead of trilogues.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, there will be a political agreement on the proposal for a revised regulation on insolvency proceedings. This represents the end of negotiations which began in January 2013 following a proposal from the Commission to modernise the existing regulation, particularly to expand its scope to ensure businesses in the EU are rescued where possible and jobs preserved. The Council is being asked to reach political agreement on the text with a view to adoption in 2015. The UK Government support this revision.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be orientation guidelines on the regulation on promoting the free movement of citizens and businesses by simplifying the acceptance of certain public documents in the EU. This measure aims to abolish the process of “legalisation” of certain public documents. Legalisation is the formality to confirm the authenticity of an official signature or seal. The regulation also proposes establishing EU multilingual forms. The Government support the principle of reducing red tape and costs and welcome recent amendments to both parts of the proposal which have limited the list of documents in scope to core civil status documents, such as birth, death and marriage certificates. They also welcome ongoing discussions to replace the proposed multilingual forms with simple translations of the original national documents rather than creating translated standalone forms with their own evidential value.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency hopes to obtain a general approach to amend the European small claims regulation. From a UK perspective the negotiations have been successful in achieving our main objectives, including returning to the current definition of what constitutes a cross-border case and ensuring that no arbitrary cap on court fees is imposed on member states. The Government would have preferred a higher threshold for a small claim than €4,000 but understand that a compromise had to be found between the different positions of the member states.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;A key requirement introduced as a result of HM Treasury’s review of the tax arrangements of public sector appointees (Cmd 8350 published in May 2012) was that Departments must exercise governance over appointments where the appointees are not engaged directly on departmental payrolls. Each Department therefore has an obligation to ensure that such appointees are paying the appropriate amount of tax and national insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 9 March 2014, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, announced Departments’ compliance with the rules governing senior off-payroll appointments in central Government in the 2012-13 financial year, Official Report, columns 9 to 13WS. We have, however, subsequently established that the information provided for the Ministry of Defence was not correct, with the consequence that we did not fully conduct the necessary tax compliance checks in a timely fashion for 2012-13.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologise to the House for this error, which was due in part to a misinterpretation of the scope of the new requirements, and I provide a restatement of the position for the Ministry of Defence:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annex 1: New off-payroll engagements between 23 August 2012 and 31 March 2013, for more than £220 per day and for more than six months, of which:

We are therefore also enhancing our own departmental controls for all such appointments so that they are not normally made until a formal declaration of compliance with tax legislation has been received from the prospective appointee. Full assurance will subsequently be sought in accordance with HM Treasury guidelines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interests of transparency, a restatement of the Ministry of Defence’s 2012-13 position will also be published in our 2013-14 annual report and accounts, which are being laid before the House today.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;A key requirement introduced as a result of HM Treasury’s review of the tax arrangements of public sector appointees (Cmd 8350 published in May 2012) was that Departments must exercise governance over appointments where the appointees are not engaged directly on departmental payrolls. Each Department therefore has an obligation to ensure that such appointees are paying the appropriate amount of tax and national insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 9 March 2014, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, announced Departments’ compliance with the rules governing senior off-payroll appointments in central Government in the 2012-13 financial year, Official Report, columns 9 to 13WS. We have, however, subsequently established that the information provided for the Ministry of Defence was not correct, with the consequence that we did not fully conduct the necessary tax compliance checks in a timely fashion for 2012-13.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologise to the House for this error, which was due in part to a misinterpretation of the scope of the new requirements, and I provide a restatement of the position for the Ministry of Defence:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annex 1: New off-payroll engagements between 23 August 2012 and 31 March 2013, for more than £220 per day and for more than six months, of which:

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;As part of Future Reserves 2020 (FR20), the planned five-year growth of the reserve forces’ trained strength was set out in a statement to the House on 19 December 2013, Official Report, column 121WS. This included annual trained strength targets along with intake targets. I am announcing a public consultation on the reporting of performance against these targets to ensure a consistent approach is taken across all three single services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each service uses its reserve forces differently so, when the FR20 targets were set, each service proposed some small variations in the groups of volunteer reserves that should be counted. This has resulted in inconsistent reporting of the number of volunteers against the targets. The Army excludes volunteer reserve personnel serving temporarily on full time reserve service (FTRS), whereas the RAF excludes volunteer reserve personnel serving on either FTRS or additional duties commitments (ADC) from their FR20 trained strength numbers. For both the Army and RAF these personnel are included in the numbers once their FTRS or ADC service ends and they reassume part-time volunteer status. These complications do not exist in the maritime reserves, as the Royal Navy has always counted volunteer reserves serving on FTRS or ADC towards its FR20 targets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a consistent approach to reporting across all three services, the MOD proposes that all volunteer reserve personnel serving on FTRS and ADC should be counted towards the FR20 trained strength targets. The targets themselves will not change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targets also need to reflect the use of sponsored reserves as part of our overall reserve requirement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public consultation sets out the proposal in more detail. All responses to the consultation will be considered before any decision is taken to revise the population definitions. Performance against the FR20 targets is reported in the UK armed forces quarterly personnel report (QPR) National Statistics publication. This may be amended following the outcome of the public consultation.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;This Government are committed to delivering a tax system that is fair and promotes growth and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the autumn statement 2014, the Government have announced a number of measures to reform stamp duty, land tax, help tackle tax avoidance, address unfair tax outcomes and support investment. The legislation for these measures will have immediate effect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamp duty land tax: reform of structure, rates and bands
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are introducing legislation which reforms stamp duty land tax on purchases of residential property with effect on and after 4 December so that it will be payable at each rate on the portion of the purchase price which falls within each band, rather than at a single rate on the whole transaction value. The legislation also amends the rates and thresholds to ensure this change is introduced in a fairway.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporation tax: restricting relief for internally-generated goodwill transfers between related parties on incorporation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are introducing legislation to restrict a company’s corporation tax relief where internally-generated goodwill and customer related intangible assets are acquired on the incorporation of a related party’s business. The change will be effective for all acquisitions occurring on or after 3 December 2014 to prevent forestalling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital gains tax: restricting entrepreneurs’ relief for goodwill on incorporation
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are introducing legislation to prevent claims for entrepreneurs’ relief on disposals of the reputation and customer relationships associated with a business (the “goodwill”), to a close company to which the seller is related. The change will be effective for disposals of goodwill on or after 3 December 2014 to prevent forestalling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital gains tax: entrepreneurs’ relief and deferred gains
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With effect from 3 December, the Government will allow gains which are eligible for the 10% capital gains tax rate provided by entrepreneurs’ relief (ER), but which are instead deferred into investments which qualify for the enterprise investment scheme, or into investments eligible for social investment tax relief, to remain eligible for ER when the gain is realised. Draft legislation for this measure will be published on 10 December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income tax: miscellaneous loss relief
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are introducing legislation to counter avoidance of income tax involving losses from miscellaneous transactions. Legislation denying loss relief where a miscellaneous loss, or miscellaneous income, arises from relevant tax avoidance arrangements will have effect from 3 December 2014. Legislation will also be introduced with effect from tax year 2015-16 to limit relief to miscellaneous income of the same type as the loss.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank loss-relief restriction
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will introduce legislation in the Finance Bill 2015 to restrict the use of brought forward losses by banks. The legislation will have effect from 1 April 2015, except for anti-avoidance rules that come into effect from 3 December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pressure, high temperature cluster area allowance
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are introducing legislation to create a new cluster area allowance to support the development of high pressure, high temperature projects and encourage exploration and appraisal activity in the surrounding area or “cluster”. The allowance will exempt a portion of a company’s profits from the supplementary charge. The amount of profit exempt will equal 62.5% of the qualifying capital expenditure a company incurs in relation to a cluster area on or after 3 December 2014.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inheritance tax exemption for medals and other awards
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are extending the existing inheritance tax exemption for medals and other decorations that are awarded for valour or gallantry. From 3 December 2014, it will apply to all decorations and medals awarded to the armed services or emergency services personnel, and to awards made by the Crown for achievements and service in public life. Draft legislation for this measure will be published on 10 December.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate debt
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are introducing legislation to repeal rules concerning the tax treatment of deferred interest and discounts on debt issued to UK companies by a connected company in a non-qualifying territory. The repeal will have effect for loans entered into on or after 3 December 2014; for loans already existing at that date it will be effective in respect of interest accruing after 31 December 2015. If the creditor or the terms of an existing loan are changed between 3 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the repeal will have effect for that loan in respect of interest accruing after the change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details on the measures listed above can be found on the gov.uk website.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;As part of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that this Government helped to initiate and have championed, the OECD has been considering preferential intellectual property regimes which include the UK’s Patent Box. Work by the OECD has focused on agreeing new rules on the level of substantial activities required for a preferential regime to be considered a tax relief that supports real economic activity and not to be considered “harmful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OECD proposed a number of methods to determine substantial activity. While the UK and three other countries supported the “transfer pricing” method, a significant majority of OECD-G20 members supported the alternative modified nexus method. The UK expressed concerns about the modified nexus approach but in the interests of reaching agreement on this important issue, agreed to work with Germany to try to find a compromise position.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 11 November 2014, the UK and Germany duly published a joint statement which outlined a compromise proposal to be put to the OECD-G2Q members at the forum on harmful tax practices (FHTP) and to EU member states at the code of conduct group. This compromise proposal adopts the main features of the modified nexus approach, but amends these in order to take account of previously expressed UK concerns.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compromise proposal was presented to the FHTP at its meeting from 17 to 19 November, and to the code of conduct group on 20 November. The proposal was welcomed and will now form the basis of continuing work by the FHTP to determine how the approach will work in practice. As part of the agreement, countries with existing IP regimes must agree to close these to
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;new entrants by 30 June 2016 and will abolish them by 30 June 2021, after which all countries will be required to operate only nexus-compliant regimes. The legislative process to introduce changes to existing IP regimes so that continuing IP regimes conform to the re-modified nexus approach will also begin in 2015. In line with the normal tax policy-making process, the Government intend to consult on these changes, once the FHTP has completed work on the detail of the new rules.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes that the Government have secured to the original approach proposed by the OECD will protect the interests of the UK as an excellent location for technology based businesses by retaining a competitive Patent Box regime, which will now align benefits more closely to research and development activity carried out in the UK. As such, the Government are confident that the new regime will continue to incentivise innovation and its commercialisation in the UK.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Telecommunications Council will take place in Brussels on 27 November 2014. The deputy permanent representative to the EU, Shan Morgan,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?notus-xml column=30?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;will represent the UK at this Council, and below are the agenda items and the positions the UK intends to adopt on each of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first item is a progress report from the presidency on proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the accessibility to public sector bodies’ websites (First reading EM 16006/11). While no formal debate is scheduled on the agenda it is expected that some member states may wish to intervene. In this instance the UK’s intervention will strongly support the presidency’s progress report.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second item is a report on state of play on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down measures concerning the European single market for electronic communications and to achieve a connected continent. (First reading EM 13562/13 and 13555/13 +ADDS 1-2).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I intend to indicate the UK’s continued support for a simplified regulation and in particular an outcome that leads to the cessation of mobile roaming charges by 2016, along with increased consumer protection. I will also signal our support for a principles-based and outcome-focused net-neutrality regulation. Finally, we will reiterate our stance, whereby we do not support an outcome that would give the Commission further competency over spectrum management.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These items will be followed by a debate on the mid-term review of the Commission’s EU 2020 strategy EU2020 preparation of mid-term review. (EU 2020 is the 10-year strategy proposed by the European Commission on 3 March 2010 for advancement of the economy of the European Union. It aimed to produce “smart, sustainable, inclusive growth” with greater co-ordination of national and European policy). The questions in the main focus on the way forward for the digital agenda for Europe (DAE), which is one of the seven flagship initiatives under the EU2020 strategy. The UK’s intervention will include: the UK welcomes the Commission’s decision to prioritise actions to boost the digital economy; and the UK believes the Commission’s plan should focus on five aspects of the digital economy as a coherent package: commerce, data, competition and protection, copyright and telecommunications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then follow discussion on draft council conclusions on internet governance. We are expecting these conclusions to be discussed in detail and it is not clear whether or not they will be agreed. The current text goes into a great number of detailed policy questions and consequently there are a number of unresolved differences of view. The UK has argued that the conclusions should not undermine the role of key organisations in the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance, should not seek to enlarge the role of Governments in that model and should not call on European member states to speak with one voice on these issues. Unless these issues are adequately resolved, the UK will not be able to accept Council conclusions. Other member states may also block consensus, if their own detailed concerns are not addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by two items under AOB, the first being information from the presidency on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high level of network and information security across the Union. (First reading EM6342/13). We do not intend to intervene on either of these items.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, under AOB, the Latvian delegation will inform the Council of their priorities for their forthcoming presidency before Council adjourns until the next meeting in summer 2015.

I will also signal our support for a principles-based and outcome-focused net-neutrality regulation. Finally, we will reiterate our stance, whereby we do not support an outcome that would give the Commission further competency over spectrum management.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These items will be followed by a debate on the mid-term review of the Commission’s EU 2020 strategy EU2020 preparation of mid-term review. (EU 2020 is the 10-year strategy proposed by the European Commission on 3 March 2010 for advancement of the economy of the European Union. It aimed to produce “smart, sustainable, inclusive growth” with greater co-ordination of national and European policy). The questions in the main focus on the way forward for the digital agenda for Europe (DAE), which is one of the seven flagship initiatives under the EU2020 strategy. The UK’s intervention will include: the UK welcomes the Commission’s decision to prioritise actions to boost the digital economy; and the UK believes the Commission’s plan should focus on five aspects of the digital economy as a coherent package: commerce, data, competition and protection, copyright and telecommunications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will then follow discussion on draft council conclusions on internet governance. We are expecting these conclusions to be discussed in detail and it is not clear whether or not they will be agreed. The current text goes into a great number of detailed policy questions and consequently there are a number of unresolved differences of view. The UK has argued that the conclusions should not undermine the role of key organisations in the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance, should not seek to enlarge the role of Governments in that model and should not call on European member states to speak with one voice on these issues. Unless these issues are adequately resolved, the UK will not be able to accept Council conclusions. Other member states may also block consensus, if their own detailed concerns are not addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by two items under AOB, the first being information from the presidency on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high level of network and information security across the Union. (First reading EM6342/13). We do not intend to intervene on either of these items.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, under AOB, the Latvian delegation will inform the Council of their priorities for their forthcoming presidency before Council adjourns until the next meeting in summer 2015.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;(Representing the Speaker’s Committee on the Electoral Commission): The Electoral Commission has today published a report containing an analysis of the confirmation live run (CLR) exercise that took place in Scotland in September 2014, and which forms the first stage in the transition to individual electoral registration (IER). The report also summarises general progress with the implementation of IER in Scotland to date. The Commission reported separately on progress with the transition in England and Wales in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition to IER in Scotland began in September 2014, following the referendum on independence. The transition is therefore taking place against a background of unprecedented levels of public engagement and participation, which led to a welcome increase in registration levels in Scotland.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation is the process of matching existing electors’ details against the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) database as well as against locally held data to identify which electors could be transferred automatically to the new IER registers, and which ones could not and therefore need to re-register. However, no existing elector will be removed from the registers ahead of the general election as a result of the change to IER.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the report finds that the results of the live run are largely in line with the results from the test of the confirmation process in 2013 and are broadly consistent with the results in England and Wales.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Scotland approximately 3.6 million electoral register entries were matched, the majority of which could be directly transferred onto the new IER registers. This corresponds to 86% of the total number of records on the electoral registers sent for matching. A total of 589,000 could not be positively matched with the DWP database or through local data matching and could therefore not be automatically transferred onto the new IER registers. EROs in Scotland will now be focusing their time and resources on targeting the 14% of existing electors who could not be matched, as well as those not currently on the registers at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent to the confirmation process, EROs have been writing out to all electors who could not be automatically transferred to the new IER registers and
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;inviting them to re-register. The Electoral Commission ran a public awareness campaign between 16 October and 13 November to ensure that electors knew to expect a letter telling them how they were affected by the change and if they needed to take any action. This supported targeted engagement activity carried out locally by EROs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission’s analysis of the test of the confirmation process in 2013 indicated that there are particular groups who are less likely to be matched with DWP data including students, young people and those renting from a private landlord. This is likely to be because they change address more frequently than the rest of the population and their details held by DWP are therefore less likely to be up to date. Encouragingly, the Commission’s analysis of the live results suggests that local data matching helps to mitigate this problem to an extent, with some of these groups being able to be matched against local data sources such as council tax databases.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the change to IER in Great Britain, for the first time, people have been able to register to vote online. The Commission reports that the take-up of online registration has been positive since the system launched in England and Wales in June and in September in Scotland. Over 2.4 million applications to register have so far been submitted through the online system across Great Britain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Electoral Commission will continue to monitor the transition to IER closely. The Commission will report again on progress in Scotland in April 2015 following the publication of the revised registers by 2 March 2015. A further report on progress across Great Britain will be published in the summer of 2015, which will include the Commission’s assessment of whether it would be appropriate to bring forward the end of the transition to IER from December 2016 to December 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Electoral Commission has also produced a data visualisation tool which is available on its website and will be e-mailed to all MPs. This allows Members of Parliament to see the confirmation rate for their constituency and for the electoral wards within it. It also includes data by local authority area. Copies of the Commission’s report have been placed in the Library of the House and it is also available on the Commission’s website at: www.electoralcommission.org.uk

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, together with the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development, is today publishing the forty second progress report on developments in Afghanistan since November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 27 October the final UK personnel were flown from Camp Bastion to Kandahar airfield. This followed the formal handover of responsibility for Camp Bastion to the Afghan military the previous day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Independent Election Commission announced the final, certified results of the provincial council elections on 25 October. 458 candidates were elected to the provincial councils, with 21 % of seats going to women.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the serious fiscal crisis faced by the new Afghan Government, the UK agreed to make £15.6 million of previously committed funding available more quickly to the Government of Afghanistan. This is not new money. It will be delivered through the World Bank managed Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund and will allow basic services to continue to be delivered to the people of Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK and the Afghan Government agreed the London conference on Afghanistan will take place on 3-4 December. This is a key opportunity for the international community to signal its continued support for the Government of Afghanistan and their vision for reform, underpinned by the principle of mutual accountability and aid effectiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am placing the report in the Libraries of both Houses. It will also be published on the gov.uk website at: www.gov.uk/government/publications/afghanistan-progress-reports

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, together with the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development, is today publishing the forty second progress report on developments in Afghanistan since November 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 27 October the final UK personnel were flown from Camp Bastion to Kandahar airfield. This followed the formal handover of responsibility for Camp Bastion to the Afghan military the previous day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Independent Election Commission announced the final, certified results of the provincial council elections on 25 October. 458 candidates were elected to the provincial councils, with 21 % of seats going to women.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the serious fiscal crisis faced by the new Afghan Government, the UK agreed to make £15.6 million of previously committed funding available more quickly to the Government of Afghanistan. This is not new money. It will be delivered through the World Bank managed Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund and will allow basic services to continue to be delivered to the people of Afghanistan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK and the Afghan Government agreed the London conference on Afghanistan will take place on 3-4 December. This is a key opportunity for the international community to signal its continued support for the Government of Afghanistan and their vision for reform, underpinned by the principle of mutual accountability and aid effectiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am placing the report in the Libraries of both Houses. It will also be published on the gov.uk website at: www.gov.uk/government/publications/afghanistan-progress-reports

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing the Government response to the “Transforming Legal Aid: Crime Duty Contracts” consultation published on 24 September. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consultation was specifically about the reports produced by KPMG LLP and Otterburn Legal Consulting regarding the legal aid litigator market, which helped inform decisions on the number of criminal legal aid duty contracts to be offered across England and Wales in 2015. We have thoroughly reviewed all the responses received.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Legal Aid Agency will let 527 crime duty contracts. This has been revised from 525. The LAA is also today issuing an invitation to tender for those organisations eligible to apply for a 2015 duty provider crime contract. Contracts have already been awarded for own client work, the other type of criminal legal aid contract we announced in February.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide further help to firms in rural areas, we have decided to introduce payments for travelling times in excess of 90 minutes. We will also relax the office requirements in the split procurement areas and London to give greater flexibility. This builds on the support measures introduced earlier, such as introducing interim payments for lawyers involved in lengthy Crown court cases and establishing a business partnering network to help practitioners with organisational and financial advice, if they need it. We have also worked with the British Business Bank to develop guidance and advice specifically for the legal aid market.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have previously informed the House that a second fee reduction for litigators is forecast for mid-2015. The Legal Aid Agency are inviting bidders to bid on the basis that the fee reduction will take place in July, subject to the further considerations we have already said we will undertake.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to inform the House that following a rigorous competition I intend to award the Intercity East Coast franchise to Inter City Railways Ltd, a joint venture between Stagecoach Transport Holdings Ltd and Virgin Holdings Ltd, pending the successful completion of a standstill period of at least 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new franchise will run for eight years from 1 March 2015 to 31 March 2023 with a further extension of one year callable at my discretion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a significant step forward not just for this vital and historic route but for our whole transport system. Traffic on our railways has more than doubled since privatisation from 750 million to 1.6 billion journeys a year. With Network Rail we are investing £38 billion in maintaining and improving the system. The new franchise will realise the benefits of this investment. It will be good for towns and cities up and down the east coast of England and Scotland, and good for our economy and jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This franchise will provide over £140 million in investment for passengers: faster journey times; new trains; more services; 50% more capacity; lower headline fares; free wi-fi and connects five towns that have never been connected to this franchise before. It provides strengthened services to the north of England, Scotland and Lincolnshire. We asked for transformation; our new partner will achieve this with what will be a renewed railway.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach and Virgin have long-term plans to build on the work done by the public sector operator and improve the franchise for passengers. Stagecoach and Virgin will also deliver for taxpayers by providing an improved premium of £3.3 billion—nominal—to Government over the next eight years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flexibility in our specification has allowed Stagecoach and Virgin to use its experience and put together a new timetable that not only continues service levels to every current mainline station but significantly enhances the levels of service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach and Virgin will strengthen the vital links from London to Scotland; all the way along the route as far as Aberdeen and Inverness. Passengers will benefit from regular, faster, more frequent cross-border services to Falkirk, Stirling and Edinburgh, with journeys between London and Edinburgh regularly taking just four hours by May 2020.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England will also receive greatly improved services. By May 2020, Leeds will see regular journey times of two hours while Leeds, Bradford, Shipley, Harrogate and Horsforth will see more services each day when compared to the current timetable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Thornaby, Huddersfield and Dewsbury, will all get services on InterCity East Coast for the first time as a result of this competition and Lincoln, which gets just one train a day to London, under the current operator will get one every two hours by May 2019 with the new one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these destinations will be served by the new Intercity Express trains by May 2020. They will be built in the heart of the north-east at the new plant in Newton Aycliffe. These trains will provide more reliable services, more seats and more leg and luggage space. The new operator will provide 50% more capacity across the InterCity East Coast and a 40% increase in morning peak seats to and from Kings Cross. Stagecoach and Virgin plan better catering with more staff on board trains to help passengers. They will not make passengers wait for the new trains to bring improvements. Stagecoach and Virgin will perform a major refurbishment of the existing fleet. This will bring them up to a high standard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stagecoach and Virgin plans to reduce some of the most expensive standard class fares on the franchise by up to 10% from May next year. Passengers will also have the chance to register to get automatic delay-repay payments at times of disruption and benefit from a loyalty and rewards scheme. Stations will see investment too with more car parking spaces, additional secure cycling facilities and electric vehicle charging points.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A benefits package worth £5 million will be available to all of its employees. Stagecoach and Virgin will invest heavily in skills, not just for their staff but for the railway as a whole. There will be a graduate programme and new apprenticeships, and the operator will create the national academy for rail professional education with bases in London, York and Derby. This will provide good training at a reduced cost; helping the whole of the industry by reducing the barriers to employment in it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This award is further proof that private competition is good for passengers, local communities and taxpayers.

Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) updated the House on the start of an independent feasibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?notus-xml column=43?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;study on resettlement of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) by its former inhabitants. KPMG were appointed as independent consultants commissioned to carry out this study. Today KPMG will publish its draft final report in full. It is available via the Overseas Territories website at: www.gov.uk. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with its terms of reference, the feasibility study has examined the full range of options for resettlement on each of the islands of the territory, including Diego Garcia with its vital military base. Final views are now sought from the Chagossian community and all those with an interest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study will conclude and issue its final report to Ministers in January 2015.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;On 19 November 2013 my predecessor, the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) updated the House on the start of an independent feasibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;?notus-xml column=43?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;study on resettlement of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) by its former inhabitants. KPMG were appointed as independent consultants commissioned to carry out this study. Today KPMG will publish its draft final report in full. It is available via the Overseas Territories website at: www.gov.uk. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with its terms of reference, the feasibility study has examined the full range of options for resettlement on each of the islands of the territory, including Diego Garcia with its vital military base. Final views are now sought from the Chagossian community and all those with an interest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study will conclude and issue its final report to Ministers in January 2015.

This is the fifth and final annual independent review, as required by the Welfare Reform Act 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Litchfield has reported on the evolution of the work capability assessment since 2008, as well as progress made in implementing recommendations made in the previous independent reviews. He has explored how these changes have had an impact on the operation of the work capability assessment and the way in which it is perceived. He has recommended further minor changes to the assessment and recognised the need for a period of stability for the current WCA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work capability assessment is integral to the Government’s commitment to ensuring that as many people as are able to do so engage in employment and those who genuinely cannot work receive the appropriate support.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcome Dr Litchfield’s report as a key step in making sure the assessment is as effective as possible and will carefully consider his report and recommendations. The Government’s response to Dr Litchfield’s report will be published during this Parliament.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I have today (28 November 2014) announced that the Government intend, following a public consultation, to increase the national speed limit for heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes on dual carriageway roads from 50 mph to 60 mph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complements the decision that the Government have already announced to raise the national speed limit for HGVs over 7.5 tonnes on single carriageway roads, and is part of a wider package of associated measures that the Government are bringing forward to continue to increase economic efficiency and remove outdated restrictions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national speed limit increase on dual carriageways will modernise an outdated regulation dating from the 1980s, better reflecting the capabilities of modern HGVs. It will help to free professional hauliers from unnecessary regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change will ensure that HGV speed limits are proportionate and better aligned with the limits for HGVs on motorways and single carriageways, and with other vehicles such as coaches and cars towing caravans. Our evidence indicates that actual average speeds are unlikely to change in response to the change in national speed limit. Our impact assessment, which has been scrutinised by independent experts, concludes that there is not expected to be an adverse effect on road safety, but we will be monitoring the impacts closely.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed limit increases for HGVs will be implemented via a change in the law to be put to Parliament during the next few months, with implementation scheduled for 6 April 2015. The existing limits continue to apply until the change has been put into effect. The amended speed limit will cover dual carriageway roads in England and Wales, unless specific lower local or urban speed limits are in effect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is publishing the summary of dual carriageway HGV speed limit consultation responses. The Department is also publishing an impact assessment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of these documents will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change will ensure that HGV speed limits are proportionate and better aligned with the limits for HGVs on motorways and single carriageways, and with other vehicles such as coaches and cars towing caravans. Our evidence indicates that actual average speeds are unlikely to change in response to the change in national speed limit. Our impact assessment, which has been scrutinised by independent experts, concludes that there is not expected to be an adverse effect on road safety, but we will be monitoring the impacts closely.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed limit increases for HGVs will be implemented via a change in the law to be put to Parliament during the next few months, with implementation scheduled for 6 April 2015. The existing limits continue to apply until the change has been put into effect. The amended speed limit will cover dual carriageway roads in England and Wales, unless specific lower local or urban speed limits are in effect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Transport is publishing the summary of dual carriageway HGV speed limit consultation responses. The Department is also publishing an impact assessment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of these documents will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;Later today, I will publish Command Paper Cm 8967, the Government response to the Work and Pensions Select Committee report on employment and support allowance (ESA) and work capability assessment (WCA). I would like to thank the Committee for its report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are committed to reviewing and improving the service they offer disabled people and those with long-term health conditions. We have made a number of improvements to these provisions over the course of this Parliament, and recently appointed Maximus as the new provider of the WCA from March 2015.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of disabled people in employment has increased by 259,000 in the last year to 3.07 million. However, we are not complacent and recognise that more support is needed for people in receipt of incapacity
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;benefits. Every one of these people has something to contribute to society and we are determined to support them in realising their full potential.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I am announcing a series of measures to further improve the support we offer disabled people and those with health conditions. From early 2015 we will run a range of pilots to test additional approaches to supporting ESA claimants. This will include testing more intensive support during the first six months following the completion of the Work programme; voluntary employment-related interventions and occupational health advice for those awaiting a WCA; and testing the impact of the claimant commitment for ESA claimants.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2015 we plan to introduce a measure allowing individuals to remain on JSA for up to 13 weeks during a period of sickness. This will ensure claimants with short-term conditions remain closer to the labour market. In addition by next spring we plan to introduce a measure preventing claimants being paid the ESA assessment rate if they have already been found fit for work but have then made a repeat claim for benefit without developing a new health condition or having seen a deterioration in their current condition.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will inevitably be some individuals whose condition affects them so severely that they may not be able to return to full-time employment. We will of course continue to provide comprehensive support for this group as well as look at ways of improving the service we already deliver.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This major reform will add over 1,300 extra lane miles on motorways and trunk roads and fix some of the most notorious and longstanding problem areas on the strategic road network. These plans are published today in the first ever road investment strategy, which has been developed to keep the population connected and the economy growing.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce to the House the details of the first road investment strategy, an ambitious £15 billion plan to increase the capacity and condition of roads for motorists across England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are investing in over 100 new road schemes over this Parliament and next, 84 of which are brand new today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This major reform will add over 1,300 extra lane miles on motorways and trunk roads and fix some of the most notorious and longstanding problem areas on the strategic road network. These plans are published today in the first ever road investment strategy, which has been developed to keep the population connected and the economy growing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the road investment strategy documents have been made available in the Libraries of both Houses and can be found on the Department’s website at: www.gov.uk/dft

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Government’s commitment to infrastructure is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan. High quality infrastructure boosts productivity and competitiveness, and can unlock economic potential across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national infrastructure plan 2014 sets out an ambitious infrastructure vision for the next Parliament and beyond, reinforcing the Government’s commitment to investing in infrastructure and improving its quality and performance. It also summarises the substantial progress that has been made during this Parliament, including the completion of over 2500 different infrastructure projects or schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national infrastructure plan is underpinned by the infrastructure pipeline, which is a forward-looking, bottom-up assessment of planned public and private infrastructure investment in the UK. The refreshed infrastructure pipeline sets out over £460 billion of planned public and private investment to the end of the decade and beyond across the key infrastructure sectors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new announcements contained in the national infrastructure plan are as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood defences
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have published their six-year programme of investment in flood defences, allocating the £2.3 billion capital funding provided at the 2013 spending round.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interconnectors
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will ensure that interconnectors can participate in the 2015 capacity auction, estimating the eligible capacity of each interconnector on a case-by-case basis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swansea tidal lagoon
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will start closer discussions with Tidal Lagoon (Swansea Bay) plc to establish whether a tidal lagoon at Swansea Bay is affordable and value for money for consumers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Guarantee scheme: Moorside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HM Treasury have reached a co-operation agreement with Toshiba, GDF Suez and NuGen with the aim of issuing a statement of intent to provide a guarantee to assist the financing of a new nuclear power plant at Moorside, subject to due diligence and ministerial approval.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadband connection vouchers
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connection vouchers—the Government will provide up to £40 million to extend the SME connection voucher scheme to March 2016 and to more cities. Vouchers will be available on a first come, first served basis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;700MHz spectrum change of use
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details of the clearance process for high-value spectrum will be set out in 2015 ahead of a further auction of mobile broadband spectrum, subject to the development of delivery options by DCMS and Ofcom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northstowe
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will take forward development at Northstowe, to support accelerated delivery of up to 10,000 homes, and evaluate the feasibility and economic impact of using this model at a wider scale to support and accelerate housing supply.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barking Riverside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will agree a principal heads of terms agreement for a loan of £55 million to support the extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking line to Barking Riverside, to unlock the delivery of up to 11,000 new homes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are making the first £100 million available to fund infrastructure and land remediation at Ebbsfleet, taking forward their commitment to build the first new garden city for almost 100 years, which will deliver up to 15,000 new homes. Improvements to the A2 Bean and Ebbsfleet junctions will be delivered as part of the Highways Agency programme. The Government will also undertake a review of transport provision for the Ebbsfleet area, including Crossrail, High Speed 1, Southern and Southeastern rail services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park redevelopment (Olympicopolis)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will invest £141 million to support the London legacy development corporation and Mayor of London’s plans to build a new higher education and cultural quarter at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossrail 2
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will provide £2 million between 2014-15 and 2015-16 to support the development of a comprehensive business case produced jointly by the Department for Transport and Transport for London, to complete ahead of the next spending review. This will be combined with a full options appraisal of all potential major transport projects in London, including an extension of the Bakerloo line to improve connectivity in south-east London, and the devolution of South Eastern rail services to London.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low emission vehicle research and development
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are announcing up to £50 million between 2017-18 and 2019- 20, to support innovation in manufacturing of ultra-low emission vehicles in the UK, based on a Government contribution of £25 million for which they will seek match-funding from industry.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for ultra-low emission vehicles
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roads investment strategy sets aside £15 million between 2015-16 and 2020-21 for a national network of chargepoints for ultra-low emission vehicles on the strategic road network. The Government are also announcing further detail of three funds totalling £85 million to support ultra-low emission taxis, buses and cities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will provide an additional £10 million between 2017-18 and 2019-20 to increase ultra-low emission vehicles in London, in support of the ambition to introduce an ultra-low emission zone by 2025.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local highways maintenance grant
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have already announced that local highways maintenance funding will be increased, totalling £5.8 billion over the next six years, and can now announce how the formula grant will be broken down by region.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean vehicle technology fund
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will provide up to £4 million to extend the clean vehicle technology fund in 2014-15 which funds road vehicle modification by local authorities in order to reduce air pollution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton rail station
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister the Government will provide £44 million between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to build a new rail station at Chesterton, linked to Cambridge science park.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycle city ambition grants
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 27 November, the Government will provide £114 million between 2015-16 and 2017-18 to enable the continuation of the cycle city ambition scheme in the eight cities it already covers. This will provide capital funding for better cycle infrastructure such as segregated lanes and improved junctions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access for all
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will increase the funding for the access for all scheme by £60 million between 2015-16 and 2018-19, improving platform access at around 20 stations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwich in ninety.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government support the key recommendations of the Great Eastern main line taskforce, including upgraded infrastructure and the latest rolling stock. Bidders for the next Anglia franchise, which will start in Oct 2016, will be incentivised to submit plans for achieving these recommendations for services to Norwich in 90 minutes and associated benefits along the Great Eastern main line.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East West Rail
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will consider the outputs of the Network Rail study into the East West Rail central section—Bedford to Cambridge—as part of the planning for control period 6 (2019-24).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawlish rail services
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will support Network Rail in its work to improve the resilience of the railway at Dawlish. Additionally, it will ask Network Rail to examine wider issues surrounding connectivity to and within the south-west peninsula. Specifically, Network Rail will consider alternatives to the current mainline route to the south-west via Dawlish, including an alternative route via the north side of Dartmoor through Okehampton. This work will feed into Network Rail’s initial industry plan for control period 6 (2019-24).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bath city centre congestion relief
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcome the strategy put forward by Bath and North East Somerset council and the West of England LEP to improve transport capacity east of Bath and reduce city centre congestion. The Government will consider a business case, which will be developed by Bath and North East Somerset council that assesses the viability of proposals including a park and ride, as well as a park and rail service, located to the east of Bath.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National transport policy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government plan to lay the national networks national policy statement before Parliament this month for consideration and a formal vote

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will publish proposals for compulsory purchase reforms for consultation at Budget 2015 to make processes clearer, faster and fairer, with the aim of bringing forward more brownfield land for development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will take forward measures to ensure that the principle of development need only be established once.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will take steps to speed up section 106 negotiations, to reduce delays to the planning process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will keep speed of major decisions under review, with minimum performance thresholds increasing to 50% of major decisions made on time as performance improves.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are also announcing today a number of additional housing and planning measures:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will support a new garden town at Bicester to provide up to 13,000 new homes subject to value for money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public sector land: housing delivery
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will set ambitious targets for the release of public sector land between 2015 and 2020. Government are committed to releasing land with capacity for up to 150,000 homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordable housing
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will extend affordable housing capital investment to 2018-19 and 2019-20, to ensure that 275,000 new affordable homes can be delivered over the next Parliament.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared ownership
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will work with housing associations, lenders and the regulator to identify and lift barriers to extending shared ownership, including a consultation on options for streamlining the process for selling on shared ownership properties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing associations
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will consult on ways to increase the borrowing capacity of housing associations in relation to the valuation of properties transferred from local authorities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estates regeneration
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget 14 announced a £150 million fund to kick start the regeneration of social housing estates through repayable loans. Following a bidding round, Grahame Park, Blackwall Reach, Aylesbury Estate and New Union Wharf regeneration projects have all now been approved for funding, subject to due diligence and contract negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small applications
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will publish new data on local authorities’ performance in meeting their statutory duty to process smaller planning applications within eight weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small sites
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will work with industry and local authorities to test whether more can be done to support the approval of small sites in the planning system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the national infrastructure plan 2014 will be available on the gov.uk website and have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.

    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;The Government’s commitment to infrastructure is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan. High quality infrastructure boosts productivity and competitiveness, and can unlock economic potential across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national infrastructure plan 2014 sets out an ambitious infrastructure vision for the next Parliament and beyond, reinforcing the Government’s commitment to investing in infrastructure and improving its quality and performance. It also summarises the substantial progress that has been made during this Parliament, including the completion of over 2500 different infrastructure projects or schemes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national infrastructure plan is underpinned by the infrastructure pipeline, which is a forward-looking, bottom-up assessment of planned public and private infrastructure investment in the UK. The refreshed infrastructure pipeline sets out over £460 billion of planned public and private investment to the end of the decade and beyond across the key infrastructure sectors.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new announcements contained in the national infrastructure plan are as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flood defences
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have published their six-year programme of investment in flood defences, allocating the £2.3 billion capital funding provided at the 2013 spending round.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interconnectors
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will ensure that interconnectors can participate in the 2015 capacity auction, estimating the eligible capacity of each interconnector on a case-by-case basis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swansea tidal lagoon
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will start closer discussions with Tidal Lagoon (Swansea Bay) plc to establish whether a tidal lagoon at Swansea Bay is affordable and value for money for consumers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Guarantee scheme: Moorside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HM Treasury have reached a co-operation agreement with Toshiba, GDF Suez and NuGen with the aim of issuing a statement of intent to provide a guarantee to assist the financing of a new nuclear power plant at Moorside, subject to due diligence and ministerial approval.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadband connection vouchers
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connection vouchers—the Government will provide up to £40 million to extend the SME connection voucher scheme to March 2016 and to more cities. Vouchers will be available on a first come, first served basis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;700MHz spectrum change of use
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further details of the clearance process for high-value spectrum will be set out in 2015 ahead of a further auction of mobile broadband spectrum, subject to the development of delivery options by DCMS and Ofcom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northstowe
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will take forward development at Northstowe, to support accelerated delivery of up to 10,000 homes, and evaluate the feasibility and economic impact of using this model at a wider scale to support and accelerate housing supply.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barking Riverside
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will agree a principal heads of terms agreement for a loan of £55 million to support the extension of the Gospel Oak to Barking line to Barking Riverside, to unlock the delivery of up to 11,000 new homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent Cross
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government support the London borough of Barnet and GLA plans for the regeneration of Brent Cross which could deliver 7,500 homes, subject to a full business case.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ebbsfleet
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are making the first £100 million available to fund infrastructure and land remediation at Ebbsfleet, taking forward their commitment to build the first new garden city for almost 100 years, which will deliver up to 15,000 new homes. Improvements to the A2 Bean and Ebbsfleet junctions will be delivered as part of the Highways Agency programme. The Government will also undertake a review of transport provision for the Ebbsfleet area, including Crossrail, High Speed 1, Southern and Southeastern rail services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park redevelopment (Olympicopolis)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will invest £141 million to support the London legacy development corporation and Mayor of London’s plans to build a new higher education and cultural quarter at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roads investment strategy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are committing £15 billion between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to continue the transformation of the strategic road network, including major projects for the A303, A1, A47 and A27.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossrail 2
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will provide £2 million between 2014-15 and 2015-16 to support the development of a comprehensive business case produced jointly by the Department for Transport and Transport for London, to complete ahead of the next spending review. This will be combined with a full options appraisal of all potential major transport projects in London, including an extension of the Bakerloo line to improve connectivity in south-east London, and the devolution of South Eastern rail services to London.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low emission vehicle research and development
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are announcing up to £50 million between 2017-18 and 2019- 20, to support innovation in manufacturing of ultra-low emission vehicles in the UK, based on a Government contribution of £25 million for which they will seek match-funding from industry.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for ultra-low emission vehicles
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roads investment strategy sets aside £15 million between 2015-16 and 2020-21 for a national network of chargepoints for ultra-low emission vehicles on the strategic road network. The Government are also announcing further detail of three funds totalling £85 million to support ultra-low emission taxis, buses and cities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will provide an additional £10 million between 2017-18 and 2019-20 to increase ultra-low emission vehicles in London, in support of the ambition to introduce an ultra-low emission zone by 2025.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local highways maintenance grant
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have already announced that local highways maintenance funding will be increased, totalling £5.8 billion over the next six years, and can now announce how the formula grant will be broken down by region.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean vehicle technology fund
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will provide up to £4 million to extend the clean vehicle technology fund in 2014-15 which funds road vehicle modification by local authorities in order to reduce air pollution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesterton rail station
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister the Government will provide £44 million between 2014-15 and 2016-17 to build a new rail station at Chesterton, linked to Cambridge science park.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycle city ambition grants
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 27 November, the Government will provide £114 million between 2015-16 and 2017-18 to enable the continuation of the cycle city ambition scheme in the eight cities it already covers. This will provide capital funding for better cycle infrastructure such as segregated lanes and improved junctions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access for all
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will increase the funding for the access for all scheme by £60 million between 2015-16 and 2018-19, improving platform access at around 20 stations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norwich in ninety.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government support the key recommendations of the Great Eastern main line taskforce, including upgraded infrastructure and the latest rolling stock. Bidders for the next Anglia franchise, which will start in Oct 2016, will be incentivised to submit plans for achieving these recommendations for services to Norwich in 90 minutes and associated benefits along the Great Eastern main line.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East West Rail
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will consider the outputs of the Network Rail study into the East West Rail central section—Bedford to Cambridge—as part of the planning for control period 6 (2019-24).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawlish rail services
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will support Network Rail in its work to improve the resilience of the railway at Dawlish. Additionally, it will ask Network Rail to examine wider issues surrounding connectivity to and within the south-west peninsula. Specifically, Network Rail will consider alternatives to the current mainline route to the south-west via Dawlish, including an alternative route via the north side of Dartmoor through Okehampton. This work will feed into Network Rail’s initial industry plan for control period 6 (2019-24).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bath city centre congestion relief
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcome the strategy put forward by Bath and North East Somerset council and the West of England LEP to improve transport capacity east of Bath and reduce city centre congestion. The Government will consider a business case, which will be developed by Bath and North East Somerset council that assesses the viability of proposals including a park and ride, as well as a park and rail service, located to the east of Bath.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National transport policy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government plan to lay the national networks national policy statement before Parliament this month for consideration and a formal vote
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will publish proposals for compulsory purchase reforms for consultation at Budget 2015 to make processes clearer, faster and fairer, with the aim of bringing forward more brownfield land for development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will take forward measures to ensure that the principle of development need only be established once.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will take steps to speed up section 106 negotiations, to reduce delays to the planning process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will keep speed of major decisions under review, with minimum performance thresholds increasing to 50% of major decisions made on time as performance improves.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are also announcing today a number of additional housing and planning measures:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicester
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will support a new garden town at Bicester to provide up to 13,000 new homes subject to value for money.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public sector land: housing delivery
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will set ambitious targets for the release of public sector land between 2015 and 2020. Government are committed to releasing land with capacity for up to 150,000 homes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordable housing
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will extend affordable housing capital investment to 2018-19 and 2019-20, to ensure that 275,000 new affordable homes can be delivered over the next Parliament.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared ownership
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will work with housing associations, lenders and the regulator to identify and lift barriers to extending shared ownership, including a consultation on options for streamlining the process for selling on shared ownership properties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing associations
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will consult on ways to increase the borrowing capacity of housing associations in relation to the valuation of properties transferred from local authorities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estates regeneration
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget 14 announced a £150 million fund to kick start the regeneration of social housing estates through repayable loans. Following a bidding round, Grahame Park, Blackwall Reach, Aylesbury Estate and New Union Wharf regeneration projects have all now been approved for funding, subject to due diligence and contract negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small applications
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will publish new data on local authorities’ performance in meeting their statutory duty to process smaller planning applications within eight weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planning: small sites
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government will work with industry and local authorities to test whether more can be done to support the approval of small sites in the planning system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the national infrastructure plan 2014 will be available on the gov.uk website and have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.

    <arr name="content_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council was held in Brussels on 25 November.</str></arr>
    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council was held in Brussels on 25 November. I represented the UK for the cultural and audiovisual section of the Council and Shan Morgan, the UK’s deputy permanent representative, represented the UK for the sport section of the Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture and audiovisual
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council was invited to adopt Council conclusions relating to European audiovisual policy in the digital era. The UK supported the adoption of these Council conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council then invited Culture Ministers to state their positions on the contested wording in the draft conclusions on the EU work plan for culture (2015-18), which related to equal VAT treatment of e-books and physical books.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noted that tax issues were the sole responsibility of ECOFIN, and successfully pushed back against the contested wording. The final text represented a good outcome for the UK, and was met with broad agreement by all delegations. The presidency also reached an agreement on actions for culture in the EU’s external relations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having concluded the work plan, the presidency invited Culture Ministers to discuss the contribution of the cultural and creative sectors to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. While the majority supported culture being included in the Europe 2020 strategy, many delegations also warned that by doing so culture would be reduced to no more than a statistic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK agreed that while culture did have a contribution to make to the goals of the strategy, it was not substantial enough to merit its inclusion in the strategy itself, which should remain focused on key contributors to jobs and economic growth. Others argued that by incorporating culture into the strategy, the EU would be able to ensure that culture was mainstreamed throughout all policy areas. Some delegations highlighted that by including
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;culture in the Europe 2020 strategy, European funding that culture was not currently eligible for would become available.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sport
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council was invited to adopt Council conclusions relating to sport as a driver for innovation and growth. The UK supported the adoption of these Council conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delegates were invited to discuss sport and physical activity at school age. Although some member states had experienced a decline in sport participation and others an increase, there was general agreement among all delegations that participation in sport offered many benefits and skills to young people, and that people that had participated in sport at a young age achieved better academic results and were more employable than young people who had not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges identified during the discussion was how to motivate young people to opt for sport rather than computer games or other sedentary activities in their free time. The UK stated that major sporting events help to motivate young people to get involved in sport, as witnessed in the UK after London hosted the Olympic games in 2012. All member states stressed that another main challenge Governments faced was ensuring that sport on offer was inclusive. Several delegations cited data that showed girls were most likely to drop out of sports clubs early on or not participate in sport at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other business
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission provided a brief update on the state of play of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incoming Latvian presidency gave a summary on its priorities, which would include cultural heritage, innovative architecture and the results of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a report from the latest meeting of the World Anti-Doping Agency and a presentation on the Council of Europe’s convention against the manipulation of sports competitions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the incoming Latvian presidency set out its priorities in the field of sport, which would primarily focus on the role of sport in fostering skills and competences.

    <arr name="statementText_s"><str>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council was held in Brussels on 25 November.</str></arr>
    <arr name="statementText_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council was held in Brussels on 25 November. I represented the UK for the cultural and audiovisual section of the Council and Shan Morgan, the UK’s deputy permanent representative, represented the UK for the sport section of the Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture and audiovisual
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council was invited to adopt Council conclusions relating to European audiovisual policy in the digital era. The UK supported the adoption of these Council conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council then invited Culture Ministers to state their positions on the contested wording in the draft conclusions on the EU work plan for culture (2015-18), which related to equal VAT treatment of e-books and physical books.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noted that tax issues were the sole responsibility of ECOFIN, and successfully pushed back against the contested wording. The final text represented a good outcome for the UK, and was met with broad agreement by all delegations. The presidency also reached an agreement on actions for culture in the EU’s external relations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having concluded the work plan, the presidency invited Culture Ministers to discuss the contribution of the cultural and creative sectors to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. While the majority supported culture being included in the Europe 2020 strategy, many delegations also warned that by doing so culture would be reduced to no more than a statistic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK agreed that while culture did have a contribution to make to the goals of the strategy, it was not substantial enough to merit its inclusion in the strategy itself, which should remain focused on key contributors to jobs and economic growth. Others argued that by incorporating culture into the strategy, the EU would be able to ensure that culture was mainstreamed throughout all policy areas. Some delegations highlighted that by including
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;culture in the Europe 2020 strategy, European funding that culture was not currently eligible for would become available.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sport
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council was invited to adopt Council conclusions relating to sport as a driver for innovation and growth. The UK supported the adoption of these Council conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delegates were invited to discuss sport and physical activity at school age. Although some member states had experienced a decline in sport participation and others an increase, there was general agreement among all delegations that participation in sport offered many benefits and skills to young people, and that people that had participated in sport at a young age achieved better academic results and were more employable than young people who had not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges identified during the discussion was how to motivate young people to opt for sport rather than computer games or other sedentary activities in their free time. The UK stated that major sporting events help to motivate young people to get involved in sport, as witnessed in the UK after London hosted the Olympic games in 2012. All member states stressed that another main challenge Governments faced was ensuring that sport on offer was inclusive. Several delegations cited data that showed girls were most likely to drop out of sports clubs early on or not participate in sport at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other business
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission provided a brief update on the state of play of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership negotiations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incoming Latvian presidency gave a summary on its priorities, which would include cultural heritage, innovative architecture and the results of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a report from the latest meeting of the World Anti-Doping Agency and a presentation on the Council of Europe’s convention against the manipulation of sports competitions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the incoming Latvian presidency set out its priorities in the field of sport, which would primarily focus on the role of sport in fostering skills and competences.

    <arr name="content_t"><str>&lt;p&gt;On 30 September 2014, I launched a statutory one-month consultation seeking representations on the draft legislative order—the Education (National Curriculum) (Attainment Targets and Programmes of Study) (England) (No. 3) Order 2014 and associated regulations—required to bring the new national curriculum programme of study for science at key stage 4 into effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing the final programme of study which is set out in the revised national curriculum framework document. The new programme of study will be taught in schools alongside the new science GCSEs from September 2016. It is important to consider
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the new programme of study in tandem with the GCSE subject content, published in April 2014, and to ensure that the curriculum and qualifications are fully coherent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme of study in science at key stage 4 sets expectations that match those in the highest performing jurisdictions, and the content is closely aligned to GCSE combined science content. It focuses on the big ideas in science such as evolution and inheritance, the atomic structure and energy and forces and includes new content on developing areas such as the human genome. The working scientifically section emphasises the importance of practical work including experimental skills, analysis and evaluation of data and the understanding and nature of scientific evidence. It makes clear that working scientifically should be embedded within the subject content across all three science disciplines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publication of the key stage 4 science programme of study completes the review of the national curriculum. We have achieved our aim of ensuring that the new national curriculum provides a rigorous basis for teaching, and a benchmark for all schools to improve their performance. It represents a clear step forward for schools, ensuring that all children have the opportunity to acquire a core of essential knowledge in key subjects. The majority of the new national curriculum came into force from September 2014. The new national curriculum for English, mathematics and science for years 2 and 6 will come into force from September 2015; the new curriculum for English and mathematics for key stage 4 will be phased in from September 2015 and that for key stage 4 science from September 2016, alongside first teaching of the new GCSEs for these subjects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A copy of the revised national curriculum framework document has been placed in the Library of the House.
