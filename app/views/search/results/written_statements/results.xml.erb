            <str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend, the Minister of State for Trade and Investment (joint with Foreign and Commonwea</str>
        </arr>
        <arr name="content_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend, the Minister of State for Trade and Investment (joint with Foreign and Commonwealth Office), Lord Green, has today made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Competitiveness Council took place in Brussels on 10 and 11 December 2012. I represented the UK on internal market and industry issues on 10 December, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) represented the UK for research items on 11 December. A summary of those discussions follows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main internal market and industry issues discussed on 10 December were: state aid modernisation; industrial policy; Customs 2020; the union customs code; unified patent and the unified patent court; Single Market Act II; public procurement; and mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Council began with a policy debate on the Commission’s plans to modernise the state aid rules. Commissioner Almunia set out the principles of the initiative, namely a more focused and simplified regime better aligned with EU2020 objectives that better tackled market failure and enhanced EU competitiveness while protecting the internal market. All member states intervened to support the Commission’s objectives, and most then raised specific issues with the proposals. For example, there were calls for more flexible rules on the use of regional aid, changes to thresholds and matching funding. I intervened to support the Commission’s approach, welcoming the intention for scrutiny of state aid to focus on the most difficult cases, and stating the need to avoid the use of state aid to prop up uncompetitive firms or in supporting national champions. Commissioner Almunia then summarised the discussion and said he would take note of the points made.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next item concerned industrial policy. Firstly adoption of Council conclusions on an industrial policy communication, followed by an exchange of views on CARS2020—an action plan for a competitive and sustainable automotive industry in Europe. The Council adopted conclusions on the industrial policy communication with all member states in agreement on the compromise text. The Council then debated CARS2020. The debate in Council followed on from a dinner hosted by Commissioner Tajani the evening before the Council, which was attended by Michael Fallon, Minister for Business and Enterprise. Most member states intervened on this agenda item, acknowledging the importance of the automotive sector to the EU economy, with many stressing the importance of directing investments towards research and innovation in the sector. The impact on the automotive sector with respect to free trade agreements was also raised, with some member states advocating reciprocity in negotiations. There was also support for better regulation principles in the automotive sector, and ensuring coherence in all policies impacting the sector. I intervened to welcome the Commission’s action plan, whilst stressing that it is for individual companies to make commercial decisions based on capacity and business plans, who should be able to do this without hindrance or interference.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next substantive agenda item was a discussion on Customs 2020. The Council agreed a partial general approach on the proposed regulation, which provides a legal basis for funding the customs action programme from 2014. At our request, the Commission supported the joint Council/Commission statement confirming that provisions in the regulation fall outside of Tile V.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion then turned to the union customs code dossier. The Commission were particularly concerned to meet the June deadline for the implementation of the recast customs code. Several member states, including the UK, recognised the deadline as a challenge, expressed commitment to achieve it in terms of content and timing, but also that we should not rush to agreement. However, other member states intervened to call for a speedy resolution. The dossier will be further discussed in working groups in January.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following lunch (there was no Council-based discussion over lunch) the Council gave political endorsement to the patent package, which consists of the regulation creating a unitary patent, the regulation on the language regime and the inter- governmental agreement that would create the unified patent court. Some member states intervened to welcome the package, and some raised a few issues with the text but did not change their position regarding endorsement of the package.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Council conclusions were adopted on Single Market Act II without comment from other member states.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next substantive agenda item was the public procurement package, consisting of three measures to update EU public procurement rules. The main outstanding point was whether the measure governing procurements by utilities should allow the Commission to initiate reciprocal action against third counties that did not open their procurement markets. At COREPER the presidency had added articles that replicated the existing arrangements whereby the Council could agree, by qualified majority, to restrict access by third countries in certain circumstances. The UK argued that these provisions were not necessary given that a separate legislative proposal on reciprocity was being discussed by trade Ministers, but that we could reluctantly accept the proposal on the clear condition that: they went no further than what was already in EU law; they applied to utilities only (and not general public sector procurements covered by the main “classical” directive); and in forthcoming trilogues with the EP this position should not be changed. Several member states intervened in a similar way. The other elements of package were also discussed. The presidency concluded that general approaches had been agreed on all three texts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier UK gains relating to mutuals, defence and security (including the revisions to the utilities and concessions texts negotiated after COREPER) and “flexibilisation” of processes, were not challenged so remain in the general approach texts agreed by Council.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final substantive agenda item was mutual recognition of professional qualifications, where the presidency outlined the progress made on this directive over the past six months. Main interventions by member states concerned recognition of qualifications in the healthcare sector, while other member states called for the need for flexibility to reach agreement as soon as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several AOB items were discussed at the Council. On the consumer agenda, the presidency informed the Council that they had reached a provisional first reading agreement with the European Parliament on both instruments concerning the alternative dispute mechanism directive and the online dispute mechanism regulation. The presidency also announced that agreement had been reached on all the key provisions in the consumer programme initiative (except use of delegated acts and on the financial envelope) and the Commission also summarised the findings of the recently published consumer markets scoreboard. Three AOB items related to customs were also on the agenda. The Commission presented their report on the EU action plan on intellectual property rights 2009-12, the Council adopted a resolution on an EU customs action plan to combat intellectual property rights infringements 2013-17, and the Council also adopted conclusions on evolution of the customs union. All three dossiers passed without comment. A further AOB point concerned the European semester/annual growth survey, where the Commission discussed growth priorities over the coming year. Again, this passed without comment. The final AOB point concerned the accounting directive, where the presidency reported on the progress on negotiations with the European Parliament. There were still some issues to settle, though it was hoped agreement could be reached at the next trilogue on 18 December 2012.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 11 December the Council opened with space agenda items, with an exchange of views on a Commission communication on the future relations between the EU and the European Space Agency (ESA). Vice-President Tajani opened the debate by noting the growing role that the EU was playing in space, highlighting Galileo/Egnos and the GMES earth observation system (now named ‘Copernicus’) as particular examples of EU action in this area, and emphasised that article 189 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU, which had introduced a union competence in space, meant that the EU was now an actor in its own right, alongside member states and ESA. Given the importance of the space sector for the EU’s future competitiveness, and as the EU relied heavily on ESA to deliver research and development on its behalf, Mr Tajani argued that the time was right to review the relationship and explore a wide range of options for improved co-operation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the discussion that followed the majority of member states agreed that it was appropriate to review relations, although the tone of the Commission’s communication, which focused almost exclusively on the difficulties in the existing relationship, came in for criticism from a number of quarters. A large number (led by the UK amongst others) emphasised that they valued the role of ESA and wished to maintain it as an independent intergovernmental organisation. The UK also noted that it was unfortunate that ESA had not been invited to participate in the discussion. At the end of the debate the Irish delegation confirmed that they intend to adopt Council conclusions on this issue during their presidency.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main items discussed in the research part of the Council on 11 December were: the specific programme for Horizon 2020 (the EU’s research and innovation funding programme for 2014-20), the strategic innovation agenda (SIA) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the EURATOM programme in Horizon 2020, and the European research area and international collaboration in research.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency sought political agreement on draft texts of the specific programme (the document which sets out the scientific content of the programme) and the EIT’s SIA. On the former, member states agreed to wording in the presidency draft designed to strengthen member state oversight of the implementation of the programme through the member state committees which oversee the various elements of the programme. Several of the newer member states sought to press for amendments which would have strengthened actions aimed at widening participation in the programme; the UK, along with other member states with strong research sectors and the Commission, successfully resisted this move, arguing that the text already included compromises in this direction and that further changes would dilute the programme’s focus on excellence. There were also discussions of the civilian nature of the programme and on the provisions concerning the funding of human embryonic stem cells. Political agreement was reached on the basis of the presidency text with two minor amendments; Malta abstained.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political agreement was also reached on the EIT SIA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other business, the presidency gave a short overview of progress on the EURATOM part of the Horizon 2020 programme. The Council adopted conclusions on the European research area which underlined the importance of completing this by 2014 and Ministers held an exchange of views on international co-operation in research and innovation, based on a Commission communication on this subject.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lunchtime discussion involved Professor Anne Glover, the EU chief scientific advisor, who outlined her role and spoke on the importance of risk assessment in policy making.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the discussion that followed my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) underlined the important role that Professor Glover, other chief scientific advisors, and Ministers had to play in improving the use of scientific evidence in the policy-making process. In too many instances policies were driven by a restrictive interpretation of the precautionary principle which obstructed innovation by confusing risk and hazard, which risk undermining the EU’s ability to innovate and compete internationally in a range of fields. His intervention was picked up by others and the Irish expressed an interest in following up on it during their presidency.

The Commission presented their report on the EU action plan on intellectual property rights 2009-12, the Council adopted a resolution on an EU customs action plan to combat intellectual property rights infringements 2013-17, and the Council also adopted conclusions on evolution of the customs union. All three dossiers passed without comment. A further AOB point concerned the European semester/annual growth survey, where the Commission discussed growth priorities over the coming year. Again, this passed without comment. The final AOB point concerned the accounting directive, where the presidency reported on the progress on negotiations with the European Parliament. There were still some issues to settle, though it was hoped agreement could be reached at the next trilogue on 18 December 2012.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 11 December the Council opened with space agenda items, with an exchange of views on a Commission communication on the future relations between the EU and the European Space Agency (ESA). Vice-President Tajani opened the debate by noting the growing role that the EU was playing in space, highlighting Galileo/Egnos and the GMES earth observation system (now named ‘Copernicus’) as particular examples of EU action in this area, and emphasised that article 189 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU, which had introduced a union competence in space, meant that the EU was now an actor in its own right, alongside member states and ESA. Given the importance of the space sector for the EU’s future competitiveness, and as the EU relied heavily on ESA to deliver research and development on its behalf, Mr Tajani argued that the time was right to review the relationship and explore a wide range of options for improved co-operation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the discussion that followed the majority of member states agreed that it was appropriate to review relations, although the tone of the Commission’s communication, which focused almost exclusively on the difficulties in the existing relationship, came in for criticism from a number of quarters. A large number (led by the UK amongst others) emphasised that they valued the role of ESA and wished to maintain it as an independent intergovernmental organisation. The UK also noted that it was unfortunate that ESA had not been invited to participate in the discussion. At the end of the debate the Irish delegation confirmed that they intend to adopt Council conclusions on this issue during their presidency.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main items discussed in the research part of the Council on 11 December were: the specific programme for Horizon 2020 (the EU’s research and innovation funding programme for 2014-20), the strategic innovation agenda (SIA) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), the EURATOM programme in Horizon 2020, and the European research area and international collaboration in research.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidency sought political agreement on draft texts of the specific programme (the document which sets out the scientific content of the programme) and the EIT’s SIA. On the former, member states agreed to wording in the presidency draft designed to strengthen member state oversight of the implementation of the programme through the member state committees which oversee the various elements of the programme. Several of the newer member states sought to press for amendments which would have strengthened actions aimed at widening participation in the programme; the UK, along with other member states with strong research sectors and the Commission, successfully resisted this move, arguing that the text already included compromises in this direction and that further changes would dilute the programme’s focus on excellence. There were also discussions of the civilian nature of the programme and on the provisions concerning the funding of human embryonic stem cells. Political agreement was reached on the basis of the presidency text with two minor amendments; Malta abstained.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political agreement was also reached on the EIT SIA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other business, the presidency gave a short overview of progress on the EURATOM part of the Horizon 2020 programme. The Council adopted conclusions on the European research area which underlined the importance of completing this by 2014 and Ministers held an exchange of views on international co-operation in research and innovation, based on a Commission communication on this subject.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lunchtime discussion involved Professor Anne Glover, the EU chief scientific advisor, who outlined her role and spoke on the importance of risk assessment in policy making.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the discussion that followed my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) underlined the important role that Professor Glover, other chief scientific advisors, and Ministers had to play in improving the use of scientific evidence in the policy-making process. In too many instances policies were driven by a restrictive interpretation of the precautionary principle which obstructed innovation by confusing risk and hazard, which risk undermining the EU’s ability to innovate and compete internationally in a range of fields. His intervention was picked up by others and the Irish expressed an interest in following up on it during their presidency.

        <arr name="content_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend, the Minister of State for Trade and Investment, (joint with Foreign and Commonwealth Office), Lord Green’ has today made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House that the Government have opted in to the Council decisions relating to the accession of Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) and Tajikistan to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, opting in will help to achieve the Government’s trade policy objectives of expanding the WTO’s membership.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have supported the accession of both Lao PDR and Tajikistan to the WTO on the right terms. In acceding to the WTO, they will embrace a series of rules and commitments which form the foundation of an open, transparent and non-discriminatory global trading system which will provide important guarantees for them and for the other WTO members. Accession to the WTO will bring them more firmly into the global economy and make them more attractive places to do business.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, the Council decisions have the effect of extending to the acceding countries the horizontal commitments the UK makes to all WTO members, including in the provision of services by natural persons from third countries, otherwise known as “Mode 4”. It is the presence of these Mode 4 commitments in the relevant instruments which triggers the UK Justice and Home Affairs opt-in.

        <arr name="statementText_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My noble Friend, the Minister of State for Trade and Investment, (joint with Foreign and Commonwealth Office), Lord Green’ has today made the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform the House that the Government have opted in to the Council decisions relating to the accession of Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) and Tajikistan to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, opting in will help to achieve the Government’s trade policy objectives of expanding the WTO’s membership.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have supported the accession of both Lao PDR and Tajikistan to the WTO on the right terms. In acceding to the WTO, they will embrace a series of rules and commitments which form the foundation of an open, transparent and non-discriminatory global trading system which will provide important guarantees for them and for the other WTO members. Accession to the WTO will bring them more firmly into the global economy and make them more attractive places to do business.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, the Council decisions have the effect of extending to the acceding countries the horizontal commitments the UK makes to all WTO members, including in the provision of services by natural persons from third countries, otherwise known as “Mode 4”. It is the presence of these Mode 4 commitments in the relevant instruments which triggers the UK Justice and Home Affairs opt-in.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health, Earl Howe, has made the following written ministerial statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have today laid before Parliament their response to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee inquiry into the regulation of medical implants in the UK and the EU (Cm 8496).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government welcome the Committee’s report and its focus on the importance of increasing transparency and accountability in the regulation of medical implants. The Government agree with the Committee on:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;strengthening transparency;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving the consistent quality of notified bodies across the EU;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;increasing access to scientific expertise;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;limiting the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;building on the current regulatory system;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;introducing stricter rules on when manufacturers can rely on clinical data which is sourced from studies on a similar device; and
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving the environment for clinical investigations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are committed to further considering the Committee’s recommendations on requiring health care professionals to report serious adverse incidents and introducing a “Black Triangle Scheme”, which currently exists as a voluntary scheme for medicines, to medical devices. The Government will continue to consult with the National Joint Registry for England and Wales (NJR) on the Committee’s recommendation to publish raw data from the NJR.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As regards the Committee’s criticism that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reacted too slowly to Australian data on the safety problems of metal-on-metal hips, the Government would like to reiterate that the MHRA was the first regulatory authority in the world to issue advice on monitoring and patient management in April 2010. The analysis of data from the National Joint Registry for England and Wales was key to the worldwide action to recall the particular metal-on-metal hip system in August 2010.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Governm</str>

        <arr name="content_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Don Foster) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am setting out today the changes that will be made to the building regulations regime in England to deliver an even better and more cost-effective way of ensuring our buildings remain safe and sustainable. The changes will deliver savings of around £50 million per year to business. In addition, legislation will also be laid before Parliament shortly to amend the energy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;performance of buildings regulations and to repeal unnecessary fire provisions of local Acts which overlap national provisions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation paper issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 31 January this year contained a range of proposals to improve the building regulations regime. I am setting out today decisions on the deregulatory changes. I am also publishing today a document providing a factual summary of the responses received. The changes have been developed after active engagement with external partners and demonstrate the Government’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that where regulation is necessary the impact on business is properly considered and the associated cost minimised. Decisions on the outstanding issues relating to the energy efficiency of buildings, on better targeting of radon protection measures and the referencing of British Standards for structural design based on Eurocodes will be set out in a further Statement next year. We will also set out next year the outcome of the review of the framework of building regulations and local housing standards which I announced in October.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engagement with our external partners shows that they continue to value the national minimum standards provided by the building regulations. However, where any concerns do arise it is necessary to address them. That is why we listened to those that expressed concern with the costs associated with the electrical safety in the home provisions in Part P of the building regulations. Some have even advocated that Part P should be revoked as a burdensome requirement on competent electricians. We disagree—Part P has been a success—but we do recognise that there is scope to streamline the requirements by removing the requirement to notify smaller-scale, lower-risk electrical work to a building control body. Currently homeowners can face building control fees of upwards of £240 to have simple electrical work, such as an additional plug socket in a kitchen, approved by a local authority. This change will see the notification requirements focused on higher-risk jobs like the installation of new circuits, or work in the vicinity of showers and baths, which is the right approach. There will, of course, remain a duty for these non-notifiable works to comply with the safety provisions required by the regulations and which we have also updated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Part P seeks to achieve a reasonable balance of risk. We will continue to monitor indicators which can help identify the impact of the changes and keep this under review. But the key to ensuring electrical work is done properly is to employ competent electricians and so the department will continue to work closely with external partners to identify what more can be done to promote the importance of complying with the provisions of Part P through use of a suitably-qualified electrician. In addition, I will be bringing forward further regulations later next year that will introduce an alternative route to demonstrating compliance with Part P by allowing for third-party certification of electrical work. This will safeguard standards while providing a far cheaper way of verifying work is adequate—particularly for those carrying out DIY work. These changes will be accompanied by simpler, clearer and shorter guidance in a new Approved Document P that we will be publishing shortly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we will be making a number of other changes to the building regulations. We will amend the technical guidance in Approved Document B (fire safety). In particular, we will update guidance in respect of lighting diffusers which has grown out-of-date as lighting technology has changed considerably. We will also, in relation to wall coverings, be taking forward changes to mitigate problems associated with how the European reaction to fire classifications work in practice. In effect, the changes will maintain the status quo, for example, allowing wallpapers that are currently used to continue to be so in the future. Both these changes have been supported by independent research which shows there are no adverse impacts on safety.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also be taking forward rationalisation of guidance supporting Parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to address areas of conflict and overlap, which again impose unnecessary costs. At the same time we will clarify the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M to promote a more proportionate, risk-based approach. These changes will be delivered by clearer guidance in a new Approved Document K and amendment of other approved documents which I will be publishing shortly. We intend that all of these deregulatory changes will come into force on 6 April 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the changes to the technical provisions, we have also agreed a number of improvements to the building control system. These are relatively minor changes to benefit both local authorities and approved inspectors through changes to the procedures around completion certificates, statutory notifications and removal of the warranty link rule.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes to regulations also extend the scope for existing competent person scheme operators. This will allow more work to be self-certified and thereby avoid the need to notify a building control body or pay a building control charge.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In relation to the building regulations, we will also be publishing shortly a new Approved Document 7 which provides updated guidance on adequate materials and workmanship for building work, in particular the implications of the full implementation of the European construction products regulation on 1 July 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated energy performance of buildings regulations will also be laid before the House shortly. These, in addition to consolidating the existing regulations, transpose the requirements of the recast energy performance of buildings directive 2010 and remove unnecessary gold-plating. The directive is an EU measure designed to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of carbon produced by buildings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new requirements will be introduced on 9 January 2013. The key measures include a requirement for property advertisements to include details of the energy performance certificate rating where available; removal of the requirement to attach the front page of the certificate to any written material; exempting listed buildings from the need to have a certificate on their sale or rent; extending the current requirement for a display energy certificate in large public buildings, to public buildings above 500m² and; introducing a requirement for a certificate to be displayed in commercial premises larger than 500m² that are frequently visited by the public and where one has been previously issued.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, given this Statement relates to the regulation of buildings, I am informing the House that I will also shortly be laying regulations to repeal unnecessary fire provisions in 23 local Acts. The decision has been taken in the light of previous consultation which found no evidence to justify maintaining requirements which go beyond the necessary protection already afforded nationally through the building regulations, and lead to differing and inconsistent rules even within fire and rescue authority areas. Evidence does not establish any statistically significant impact on life safety. These changes are intended to come into force on 9 January 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be placing the revised guidance in the approved documents referred to above, along with the impact assessments that accompany all of these changes, in the Library of the House when they are published shortly and alongside the summary of responses that I am placing there today.

The changes have been developed after active engagement with external partners and demonstrate the Government’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that where regulation is necessary the impact on business is properly considered and the associated cost minimised. Decisions on the outstanding issues relating to the energy efficiency of buildings, on better targeting of radon protection measures and the referencing of British Standards for structural design based on Eurocodes will be set out in a further Statement next year. We will also set out next year the outcome of the review of the framework of building regulations and local housing standards which I announced in October.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engagement with our external partners shows that they continue to value the national minimum standards provided by the building regulations. However, where any concerns do arise it is necessary to address them. That is why we listened to those that expressed concern with the costs associated with the electrical safety in the home provisions in Part P of the building regulations.

We disagree—Part P has been a success—but we do recognise that there is scope to streamline the requirements by removing the requirement to notify smaller-scale, lower-risk electrical work to a building control body.

In particular, we will update guidance in respect of lighting diffusers which has grown out-of-date as lighting technology has changed considerably. We will also, in relation to wall coverings, be taking forward changes to mitigate problems associated with how the European reaction to fire classifications work in practice. In effect, the changes will maintain the status quo, for example, allowing wallpapers that are currently used to continue to be so in the future. Both these changes have been supported by independent research which shows there are no adverse impacts on safety.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also be taking forward rationalisation of guidance supporting Parts M, K and N (access, protection from falling, collision and impact and glazing respectively) to address areas of conflict and overlap, which again impose unnecessary costs. At the same time we will clarify the guidance on access statements in Approved Document M to promote a more proportionate, risk-based approach.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes to regulations also extend the scope for existing competent person scheme operators. This will allow more work to be self-certified and thereby avoid the need to notify a building control body or pay a building control charge.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In relation to the building regulations, we will also be publishing shortly a new Approved Document 7 which provides updated guidance on adequate materials and workmanship for building work, in particular the implications of the full implementation of the European construction products regulation on 1 July 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated energy performance of buildings regulations will also be laid before the House shortly. These, in addition to consolidating the existing regulations, transpose the requirements of the recast energy performance of buildings directive 2010 and remove unnecessary gold-plating.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Philip Hammond) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My noble friend Lord Levene of Portsoken has conducted the first annual review of implementation of his defence reform report recommendations of June 2011, and has written to me setting out his conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I welcome Lord Levene’s recognition of the strong progress made to date in implementing his recommendations, and his confidence that the delivery of the majority of them will be achieved in time to transition to a new operating model for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in April 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the key changes of defence reform are already complete, such as strengthened top-level decision-making and the focus on strategic direction from a newly-constituted defence board, which I chair. The Joint Forces Command has been established and its first commander appointed. Many other recommendations are on track for delivery by April 2013 with the implementation of the new delegated financial and military capability operating model: this will strengthen accountability and give the service chiefs much greater freedom to manage their resources and plan for future capability.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few recommendations will take longer to complete. I acknowledge that there is more to do in some areas, such as development of the whole force concept and the delivery of improved management information, and I value Lord Levene’s continued interest and focus on these important changes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am placing a copy of Lord Levene’s letter in the Library of the House, together with the MoD’s summary of progress against the 53 defence reform recommendations.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Philip Hammond) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My noble friend Lord Levene of Portsoken has conducted the first annual review of implementation of his defence reform report recommendations of June 2011, and has written to me setting out his conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I welcome Lord Levene’s recognition of the strong progress made to date in implementing his recommendations, and his confidence that the delivery of the majority of them will be achieved in time to transition to a new operating model for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in April 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the key changes of defence reform are already complete, such as strengthened top-level decision-making and the focus on strategic direction from a newly-constituted defence board, which I chair. The Joint Forces Command has been established and its first commander appointed. Many other recommendations are on track for delivery by April 2013 with the implementation of the new delegated financial and military capability operating model: this will strengthen accountability and give the service chiefs much greater freedom to manage their resources and plan for future capability.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few recommendations will take longer to complete. I acknowledge that there is more to do in some areas, such as development of the whole force concept and the delivery of improved management information, and I value Lord Levene’s continued interest and focus on these important changes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am placing a copy of Lord Levene’s letter in the Library of the House, together with the MoD’s summary of progress against the 53 defence reform recommendations.

        <arr name="content_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My honourable friend the Minister of State for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs (Jo Swinson) has today made the following Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the Government’s ongoing review of employment law, and in response to the Red Tape Challenge, I have published today the Government
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;response to the consultation on changes to the rules on collective redundancy. This sets out the Government’s decision to introduce legislative reform to those rules and new guidance by April 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultation on the collective redundancy rules concluded on 19 September 2012 having sought views on a package to encourage better quality consultation in large-scale redundancies. We received 160 responses and held a number of focus groups. Consultees confirmed difficulties with the current rules that undermine the effectiveness of collective redundancy consultation and the ability of employers to restructure efficiently in response to market pressures.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have concluded that a strong case has been made for a combination of legislative change and new guidance. We have decided to introduce a statutory change to reduce the current 90-day minimum period before very large redundancies can take place to 45 days. This change will allow businesses to restructure more effectively, and give them flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. But the 45 days will be a minimum consultation period. We received plenty of evidence to show that consultations can and do last longer than the minimum period and we expect that to continue where circumstances make this desirable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also decided to legislate to exclude fixed-term contracts which have reached their agreed termination point from collective redundancy consultation obligations. The consultation demonstrated that employers, particularly in higher education institutes, struggle with existing uncertainty around whether the natural ending of fixed-term contracts triggers a requirement for collective redundancy consultation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislative change will be through secondary legislation, subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. In addition, ACAS will produce non-statutory guidance that addresses key contentious issues raised during consultation. The aim will be to promote good quality consultation and engagement between employers and employees.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe these reforms of the collective redundancy rules will strike an appropriate balance between ensuring employees are engaged in decisions about their future and allowing employers greater certainty and flexibility to take necessary steps to restructure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copies of the Government’s response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy (John Hayes) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today publishing the response to the Maitland review’s recommendations on the UK’s offshore oil and gas regulatory regime.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 20 April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, working on the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, exploded leading to the tragic deaths of 11 personnel
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the loss of 4.9 million barrels of oil to the sea. While the offshore UK oil and gas regime is regarded as one of the strongest in the world, the Government wanted to ensure that the UK considered the findings from the official Macondo reports and their relevance to the oil and gas industry in the UK.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government asked Geoffrey Maitland, professor of energy engineering at Imperial College London, to chair an independent review panel to carry out this task. Mick Temple (retired BAA development director and currently a member of the faculty of sustainability leadership at the University of Cambridge) and Professor John Shepherd (research fellow in earth systems at the University of Southampton) also provided their considerable expertise to the panel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independently chaired panel published its report in December 2011. The report made recommendations around 10 key themes: well planning and control, environmental protection, emergency response, learning from incidents and best practice, implementation assurance, competency and training of the workforce, workforce engagement, liability and insurance, regulator issues and technology development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steering group of representatives from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the Health and Safety Executive(HSE), the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and the industry representative body Oil and Gas UK have carefully considered the Maitland review recommendations. I am pleased today to publish the response to the panel’s recommendations. I have deposited copies of the response document in the House for Members to read.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of the recommendations have been positively received and implemented in full; some of the work is ongoing, but where this applies work plans with appropriate target dates for completion are in place and detailed in the response. There were other recommendations, where after full and careful consideration, it was concluded that an alternative approach was more appropriate to achieve a similar outcome. Where this is the case, a full explanation of the work that was undertaken to reach the alternative conclusion is contained in the response.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new senior oversight group, comprising DECC, HSE and MCA, will supervise the successful implementation of the Maitland review recommendations that are still being delivered as well as ensuring that the offshore regime remains fit for purpose in the longer term.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the Government and industry responses to the independent panel’s recommendations, alongside other ongoing work, will ensure that the UKCS offshore oil and gas industry builds upon its existing high standards by: protecting the environment; engaging and safeguarding its workforce; responding to emergencies and introducing new mechanisms on financial responsibility so that petroleum licensees on the UKCS must demonstrate that they have the financial capability to response to an incident before consent is given to drill exploration and appraisal wells.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) is </str>

        <arr name="content_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) is today making the following Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing the publication of EFG lending figures by individual bank.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are committed to ensuring that viable small and medium-size enterprises can obtain the finance they need for working capital and investment. EFG plays an important part in this, with over 9,900 SMEs being offered loans with a value in excess of £1 billion since May 2010.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have made a number of important changes to the EFG scheme during the past 12 months. EFG loans are now available to an additional 3,800 businesses with an increase in the turnover limit from £25 million to £41 million. The maximum £1 million lifetime scheme limit has been replaced by a rolling £1 million limit. We also raised by 7% the level of lenders EFG annual loan portfolios to which the Government guarantee applies from 13% to 20%.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change was made to address the legitimate concern of lenders that they would breach their annual claim limit. In doing this, the Government committed to a more even share of the risk of default with the lenders, with the aim of removing that as a barrier to lending.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG is a demand led scheme, accounting for 1% to 2% of overall SME lending. While utilisation is directly linked to subdued demand for credit in the wider economy, overall EFG lending levels are disappointing. There have been some positive signs, with a number of the main banks increasing EFG lending this financial year, albeit from a low level.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that banks lend responsibly and make use of EFG when it is appropriate to do so, but it is clear from the EFG lending figures that a number of lenders could and should be doing more. The publication of individual bank EFG lending figures is intended to help achieve this. In parallel, we are exploring with the banks ways of flexing EFG to address debt serviceability, which is the principal reason behind loan declines. Further detail will be provided in the new year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, already publishes a wide range of EFG lending figures, which are updated on a quarterly basis. Publication of individual EFG lending figures will further enhance this, allowing business customers to identify which banks are making most use of the scheme, and also enable participating lenders and new market entrants to identity new opportunities, thus increasing choice and competition.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) is </str>
        </arr>
        <arr name="statementText_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Business and Enterprise (Michael Fallon) is today making the following Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am today announcing the publication of EFG lending figures by individual bank.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government are committed to ensuring that viable small and medium-size enterprises can obtain the finance they need for working capital and investment. EFG plays an important part in this, with over 9,900 SMEs being offered loans with a value in excess of £1 billion since May 2010.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Government have made a number of important changes to the EFG scheme during the past 12 months. EFG loans are now available to an additional 3,800 businesses with an increase in the turnover limit from £25 million to £41 million. The maximum £1 million lifetime scheme limit has been replaced by a rolling £1 million limit. We also raised by 7% the level of lenders EFG annual loan portfolios to which the Government guarantee applies from 13% to 20%.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change was made to address the legitimate concern of lenders that they would breach their annual claim limit. In doing this, the Government committed to a more even share of the risk of default with the lenders, with the aim of removing that as a barrier to lending.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFG is a demand led scheme, accounting for 1% to 2% of overall SME lending. While utilisation is directly linked to subdued demand for credit in the wider economy, overall EFG lending levels are disappointing. There have been some positive signs, with a number of the main banks increasing EFG lending this financial year, albeit from a low level.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that banks lend responsibly and make use of EFG when it is appropriate to do so, but it is clear from the EFG lending figures that a number of lenders could and should be doing more. The publication of individual bank EFG lending figures is intended to help achieve this. In parallel, we are exploring with the banks ways of flexing EFG to address debt serviceability, which is the principal reason behind loan declines. Further detail will be provided in the new year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, already publishes a wide range of EFG lending figures, which are updated on a quarterly basis. Publication of individual EFG lending figures will further enhance this, allowing business customers to identify which banks are making most use of the scheme, and also enable participating lenders and new market entrants to identity new opportunities, thus increasing choice and competition.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks a further step towards greater transparency in bank lending, specifically to SMEs.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Owen P</str>
        </arr>
        <arr name="content_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Owen Paterson) has today made the following Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 28 and 29 November in Brussels covering agricultural issues. I was accompanied by my honourable friend the Minister of State (David Heath) and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment, Water and Rural Affairs (Richard Benyon) who spoke on fisheries issues. Alun Davies AM, Richard Lochhead MSP and Michelle O’Neil MLA also attended.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The substantive business of the council began with a lunch for agriculture Ministers during which we discussed the topic, proposed by the presidency, of the current context of CAP reform. In the course of discussion it became clear that a significant number of member states did not share the presidency’s view that agreement of a partial general approach on the CAP reform proposals could be achieved at the December council. The presidency accordingly indicated that they would instead provide a report of the progress made on the reform package.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion in the formal session of council covered three aspects of the CAP reform package, addressing a series of questions posed by the presidency to guide discussion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On greening of direct payments, the presidency sought views on the concept of equivalence, governing any flexibility accorded to member states on how they implemented the requirements. All agreed that an equivalence regime had to be simple, transparent and efficient. Some member states highlighted the need for some form of ex ante approval process to ensure that equivalent measures implemented would not subsequently be deemed insufficient by auditors. Several member states stated that it was important to avoid double funding of the same actions through both direct payments, and rural development funding, but there was little clarity on how this would be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the regulation governing the Single Common Market Organisation the discussion focused on whether to retain the date of 2015 for ending beet sugar production quota, as agreed in previous reforms, and on vine planting rights. On sugar, some member states wanted to keep to the original agreement and end quotas in 2015, most beet-producing countries wanted to maintain quota until at least 2020 and those countries which conceded quota previously argued to have it returned. The Commission (Ciolos) held firm on its proposal. Member states also raised aspects of the regulation they were unhappy with. These included milk quotas, vine planting rights, marketing standards, reference prices and producer organisations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the rural development regulation, member states raised important outstanding issues. Most member states felt this was the closest regulation to agreement but more work was needed on several detailed aspects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Council considered a Commission proposal to permit the use of lactic acid as an anti-microbial surface treatment. No member state changed its previously indicated position, and the council offered no opinion. If the European Parliament does not reject the proposal (which now seems likely as the Parliament’s Environment Committee approved it), it will be referred back to the Commission to adopt once the four month scrutiny period expires on 3 February 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under any other business a report on the rural development error rate was raised by Commissioner Ciolos. At above 7%, it was the highest error rate across all EU budget lines and well above the materiality threshold of 2%. He identified some reasons why this might be the case and suggested that simplification as part of CAP reform could make implementation simpler.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain raised the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement, complaining that import prices for tomatoes from Morocco were below the agreed entry price. In response, the Commission pointed out that this is not unusual for this time of year, concluding that this is an issue for national customs authorities which implement the regulations. Spain acknowledged this but thought the Commission should do more to ensure that the correct levies were being applied throughout the EU.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria tabled a short paper on their new European food model, and a number of member states supported the initiative, despite its absence of clarity on mechanisms. The Commission suggested it would be a good topic for a future informal Agriculture Council, once CAP reform had concluded.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On fisheries business the council agreed total allowable catches for 2013 and 2014 for deep sea species. This was agreed by qualified majority vote, with Sweden voting against. In line with UK requests alongside the final text the Commission tabled a declaration on the need to seek scientific advice on adding the lowfin gulper shark to the list of species defined as deep sea sharks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On EU/Norway the council heard an update from the Commission on the first round of talks, and was invited to highlight priorities for the second round taking place 3-7 December. The UK underlined the importance of a successful outcome on North Sea cod and mackerel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under any other business Denmark called for a more streamlined decision making process for fixing the catch limits for Norway pout. The Netherlands also tabled a paper on their concerns on the technical conditions under the new protocol for the EU/Mauritania fisheries agreement.

            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Owen P</str>

        <arr name="statementText_t">
            <str>&lt;p&gt;My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Owen Paterson) has today made the following Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 28 and 29 November in Brussels covering agricultural issues. I was accompanied by my honourable friend the Minister of State (David Heath) and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Natural Environment, Water and Rural Affairs (Richard Benyon) who spoke on fisheries issues. Alun Davies AM, Richard Lochhead MSP and Michelle O’Neil MLA also attended.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The substantive business of the council began with a lunch for agriculture Ministers during which we discussed the topic, proposed by the presidency, of the current context of CAP reform. In the course of discussion it became clear that a significant number of member states did not share the presidency’s view that agreement of a partial general approach on the CAP reform proposals could be achieved at the December council. The presidency accordingly indicated that they would instead provide a report of the progress made on the reform package.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion in the formal session of council covered three aspects of the CAP reform package, addressing a series of questions posed by the presidency to guide discussion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On greening of direct payments, the presidency sought views on the concept of equivalence, governing any flexibility accorded to member states on how they implemented the requirements. All agreed that an equivalence regime had to be simple, transparent and efficient. Some member states highlighted the need for some form of ex ante approval process to ensure that equivalent measures implemented would not subsequently be deemed insufficient by auditors. Several member states stated that it was important to avoid double funding of the same actions through both direct payments, and rural development funding, but there was little clarity on how this would be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the regulation governing the Single Common Market Organisation the discussion focused on whether to retain the date of 2015 for ending beet sugar production quota, as agreed in previous reforms, and on vine planting rights. On sugar, some member states wanted to keep to the original agreement and end quotas in 2015, most beet-producing countries wanted to maintain quota until at least 2020 and those countries which conceded quota previously argued to have it returned. The Commission (Ciolos) held firm on its proposal. Member states also raised aspects of the regulation they were unhappy with. These included milk quotas, vine planting rights, marketing standards, reference prices and producer organisations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the rural development regulation, member states raised important outstanding issues. Most member states felt this was the closest regulation to agreement but more work was needed on several detailed aspects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Council considered a Commission proposal to permit the use of lactic acid as an anti-microbial surface treatment. No member state changed its previously indicated position, and the council offered no opinion. If the European Parliament does not reject the proposal (which now seems likely as the Parliament’s Environment Committee approved it), it will be referred back to the Commission to adopt once the four month scrutiny period expires on 3 February 2013.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under any other business a report on the rural development error rate was raised by Commissioner Ciolos. At above 7%, it was the highest error rate across all EU budget lines and well above the materiality threshold of 2%. He identified some reasons why this might be the case and suggested that simplification as part of CAP reform could make implementation simpler.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain raised the EU-Morocco agriculture agreement, complaining that import prices for tomatoes from Morocco were below the agreed entry price. In response, the Commission pointed out that this is not unusual for this time of year, concluding that this is an issue for national customs authorities which implement the regulations. Spain acknowledged this but thought the Commission should do more to ensure that the correct levies were being applied throughout the EU.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria tabled a short paper on their new European food model, and a number of member states supported the initiative, despite its absence of clarity on mechanisms. The Commission suggested it would be a good topic for a future informal Agriculture Council, once CAP reform had concluded.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On fisheries business the council agreed total allowable catches for 2013 and 2014 for deep sea species. This was agreed by qualified majority vote, with Sweden voting against. In line with UK requests alongside the final text the Commission tabled a declaration on the need to seek scientific advice on adding the lowfin gulper shark to the list of species defined as deep sea sharks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On EU/Norway the council heard an update from the Commission on the first round of talks, and was invited to highlight priorities for the second round taking place 3-7 December. The UK underlined the importance of a successful outcome on North Sea cod and mackerel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under any other business Denmark called for a more streamlined decision making process for fixing the catch limits for Norway pout. The Netherlands also tabled a paper on their concerns on the technical conditions under the new protocol for the EU/Mauritania fisheries agreement.
