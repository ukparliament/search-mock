1 Introduction 
Darlington is a borough constituency in the unitary authority of the borough of Darlington.  
Darlington ceased to be part of the county of Durham following structural changes in 1995.  
The Darlington constituency is formed of the urban wards that cover the town of Darlington.  
The four rural wards of the borough of Darlington form part of the Sedgefield constituency. 
The Darlington constituency was first created in 1868.  Since then the boundaries of the 
Darlington constituency have gradually extended to reflect the growth of the town of 
Darlington.  The parts of the modern constituency that were at one time beyond the 
boundaries, particularly in the nineteenth century, formed part of the county constituencies 
surrounding Darlington.  The boundaries of the Darlington constituency have changed very 
little since 1950.  The latest boundary changes following the Fifth Periodical Review of 
Parliamentary constituencies in England, implemented at the 2010 general election, 
transferred approximately 670 voters from the Sedgefield constituency to the Darlington 
constituency. 
 
 
 
Since the Second World War the Darlington constituency has returned mostly Labour MPs.  
The exceptions were when Conservative MPs were returned between 1951 and 1964 (Sir 
Fergus Graham 1951-1959 and Anthony Bourne-Arton 1959-1964) and from 1983 to 1992 
(Michael Fallon).  Between 1950 to 1997 the constituency was won by more than 5,000 votes 
on only one occasion.  In 1992 Alan Milburn won the seat from Michael Fallon by 2,798 
(Fallon went on to become the MP for Sevenoaks, in Kent).  Milburn held the seat at the 
three subsequent elections and the seat is generally regarded as a safe Labour seat at the 
moment. 
In his Parliamentary career Alan Milburn was a front bench spokesman for the Labour Party 
from 1995 until 1997.  Following Labour’s general election victory in 1997 he was appointed 
a Minister of State at the Department of Health.  The following year he was promoted to the 
3 


Cabinet and held three different posts, including Health Secretary, before resigning as a 
Minister in 2005.  In June 2009 he announced his intention not to seek re-election to the 
House of Commons at the next general election to “pursue challenges other than politics”.1 
At the 2010 general election the Darlington constituency was won by Jenny Chapman of the 
Labour Party.  She won with a majority of 3,388 votes. 
2 Early Representation 
Unlike many of the ancient counties, the people of Durham were not directly represented in 
Parliament until the sixteenth century, in the reign of Henry VIII.  Parliaments of the knights of 
the shires were summoned by the Monarch from the thirteenth century.  It was these 
Parliaments summoned by writ to meet that were generally regarded as the first assemblies 
of representatives.2  County Durham was a County Palatine.  This is defined as “county or 
other territory in England…as having a ruler with royal privileges and judicial authority (within 
the territory) which elsewhere belong to the sovereign alone”.3  Durham’s status as a County 
Palatine dates back to the Norman period and the power was held by the Bishops of Durham 
who had the title Prince Bishop to denote the royal authority they exercised.  The Prince 
Bishop held civil and military power and established courts and issued money.  Part of the 
reason for these special privileges was the proximity to Scotland and the remoteness from 
the Monarch.  In an emergency the Prince Bishop could act to protect the county without 
delay.4   
County Durham appears in the returns twice in the Parliaments of 1654 and 1656.  These 
were the Protectorate Parliaments that followed Oliver Cromwell’s Instrument of Government 
that declared Cromwell Lord Protector.  The Instrument was an attempt to redistribute seats 
on a more equitable basis.5  Durham’s representation was suspended following the 
Restoration in 1660 and power returned to the Prince Bishop but Members were again 
returned to the Parliament of 1661 summoned by Charles II.  An Act of Parliament in 1672 
confirmed both the city and county of Durham’s representation in the English Parliament from 
1678.6  The returns for Durham for Cromwell’s Parliament summoned in 1654 did not survive 
but the two county Members from the 1656 Parliament are named as Thomas Lilburne and 
James Clavering.7  The pattern of representation remained unaltered until the reforms of 
1832, with four Members returned to Parliament, two to represent the county and two to 
represent the city of Durham. 
3 Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Changes 
3.1 Great Reform Act of 1832 
The Representation of the People Act 1832 was the Act that reformed the distribution of 
seats in England and Wales. It introduced the principle of splitting the shire counties into 
divisions and returning two Members for each division rather than for the whole county and it 
also reformed the Parliamentary boroughs that were entitled to send Members to

Parliament.8  The City of Durham retained its status as a Parliamentary borough with the 
right to return two Members.  In addition Sunderland was established as a two Member 
Parliamentary borough, and Gateshead and South Shields became single Member 
Parliamentary boroughs.  Darlington was not granted separate Parliamentary representation. 
Durham was divided into two divisions, each of which returned two MPs.  The Boundary 
Commission proposals that followed the Act, published in 1832, made recommendations on 
the boundaries of the Parliamentary boroughs and divisions of counties that had been listed 
in Schedule F.9  The recommendations of the Boundary Commission were implemented by 
the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832.10  These changes gave the county a total of ten 
seats in the reformed House of Commons.  This was an increase of six from the pre-1832 
arrangements. 
The county was already divided into four wards and the Boundary Commission decided to 
use them to split the county.  The Northern division of the county comprised the Chester and 
Easington wards, with the Southern division comprised of the Darlington and Stockton wards.  
Both divisions of the county were exclusive of the areas included within the four 
Parliamentary boroughs.  They also excluded the isolated parts of Durham that lay between 
Newcastle and Berwick.  Those areas, Norhamshire, Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire were 
annexed to Northumberland for the purposes of Parliamentary representation.  This meant 
that Darlington was represented by the two MPs for the Southern division of the county of 
Durham after 1832. 
3.2 Boundary Commission Review 1868 
The 1868 review carried out by the Boundary Commission followed the Representation of the 
People Act 1867. This Act appointed the Commission to inquire into the boundaries of the 
new boroughs created by the Act; the counties the Act had newly divided, and to review all 
other existing boroughs that had not been disenfranchised by the Act. In inquiring into 
existing boroughs, the Commissioners had the power to recommend extension of borough 
boundaries if it thought this was appropriate. This Act also increased the number of Members 
representing each of the growing industrial cities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and 
Liverpool, from two to three.11 The Commissioners conducted local inquiries and reported in 
1868. 
In county Durham none of the existing Parliamentary boroughs were abolished and the 
numbers of seats in these boroughs were left unchanged.  The city of Durham and 
Sunderland had their boundaries extended but South Shields was unaltered.  Three new 
Parliamentary boroughs were created:  Darlington, the Hartlepools, and Stockton.  All three 
were designated single Member boroughs.   
The two county divisions remained unaltered except for those areas that had been absorbed 
into the extended or newly created Parliamentary boroughs.  This meant that the total 
number of Members in the county increased to thirteen as a result of the creation of the three 
new boroughs. 
The new Parliamentary borough of Darlington was temporarily defined as comprising the 
townships of Darlington, Haughton-le-Skerne, and Cockerton by the RPA 1867.  However,

the Boundary Act 1868, which implemented any alterations resulting from the Boundary 
Commission inquiries, defined the Parliamentary borough of Darlington as being the same as 
the municipal borough of Darlington.12  This excluded Cockerton and Haughton.  It also 
excluded Blackwell in the south.  The western boundary was Baydale Beck, with Cocker 
Beck forming the north western boundary.  In the north east the river Skerne marked the 
borough boundary and the northern limit of the borough, along the North Road, was 
approximately where Thompson Street is today.  The southern boundary approximated to the 
modern route of Consicliffe Road in the west but extended further south in the east to include 
the area around the modern location of Darlington Cricket Club.  A small area of Oxen-le-
Fields was administratively part of Darlington but was excluded from the Parliamentary 
borough. 
The boundaries of Darlington implemented in 1868 meant that some parts of the modern 
constituency lay beyond the boundary.  These areas continued to be represented by the two 
MPs for the Southern division of the county of Durham. 
3.3 Boundary Commission Review 1885 
The next review occurred in 1885. In major cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham 
there was a major change to the distribution of seats. Until now these had been 
parliamentary boroughs returning multiple members. The Redistribution of Seats Bill made 
provision for larger boroughs to be divided into single Member divisions. A Boundary 
Commission was established to recommend boundaries while the Bill was still going through 
Parliament. The Commission was appointed in November 1884 and reported in February 
1885.13 The recommendations were incorporated into the Bill which became the 
Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.14 
There were two alterations to the Parliamentary boroughs in the county of Durham.  Durham 
city was reduced to a single Member seat and the borough of Darlington had its boundaries 
altered. 
The Act also altered representation in many of the counties.  Several counties were divided 
into single Member divisions. Durham was one such county and the Act divided the areas of 
the county not included in Parliamentary boroughs into eight divisions.  This gave the county 
a total of sixteen Members, a net increase of three.  The constituencies created contained a 
mix of petty sessional divisions and parishes.  Petty sessional divisions were the 
geographical area of operation of magistrates’ courts within counties for the administration of 
local summary justice.  These have since been replaced by fewer and larger modern petty 
sessional areas.15 
The borough boundaries of Darlington had not grown significantly so the area of the 
Parliamentary borough saw only minor adjustment.  The areas not included in the borough 
formed part of a new constituency named South East Durham.

3.4 Boundary Commission Review 1917 
The next Boundary Commission review reported in 1917,16 and the results were incorporated 
into the Representation of the People Act 1918.17 The Act made many changes to 
constituencies and elections in the UK. 
In this review the Boundary Commission used local government administrative areas, as they 
existed at the time, to construct constituencies.  There was also far less detail printed than in 
modern reviews.  This makes direct comparison with other reviews difficult. 
In Durham county, the city of Durham was abolished as a Parliamentary borough and was 
merged into the county seats.  The other six boroughs were retained, with Sunderland 
retaining two Members and all the others each returning a single Member.  The county at 
large was divided into eleven single Member constituencies.  This gave the county a total of 
eighteen seats. 
The Parliamentary borough of Darlington was extended to include the whole of the municipal 
borough of Darlington, which had grown since the 1885 review.  The borough had been 
extended to include most of Cockerton and parts of Haughton, although most of Haughton 
remained as a separate parish.  This meant that an increased area of the modern 
constituency was within the boundaries of the Parliamentary borough created by this review.  
The areas not included in the borough, including the parish of Haughton, formed part of a 
new constituency named Sedgefield. 
4 Boundary Commission Periodical Reviews 
The regular reviews of Parliamentary constituencies have their origins in the House of 
Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944. This Act instructed the Boundary Commission 
for England to conduct an initial review of all seats with a view to keeping them under 
constant review. One of the Rules in this review was that all two Member boroughs should be 
divided and return a single Member for each division unless the Commission felt it 
“undesirable to divide it”. The recommendations of the initial review were published in 
1947.18 This formed the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1948.19 The following 
year the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 was passed, which repealed 
the 1944 Act, but took the principle of periodic review forward and established the rules for 
the reviews. 20  
 
In county Durham the situation in the Parliamentary boroughs remained largely unaltered.  
The only real difference was that Sunderland was split into two single Member constituencies 
rather than the whole borough returning two Members, as had been the case since 1832.  
The other five Parliamentary boroughs continued to be single Member constituencies.  The 
remaining parts of the county were divided into ten single Member constituencies.  This was 
a reduction of one. 
By the time of the Initial Review the borough of Darlington had grown again.  The boundaries 
of the constituency of Darlington were adjusted to make them coterminous with the borough.  
It meant that the constituency boundaries were recognisable as those that still exist today.

The maps provided with the earlier reviews are not sufficiently detailed to draw exact 
conclusions but only a small number of electors currently in the Darlington constituency 
would have been beyond the constituency boundary at this time.  The area surrounding 
Darlington was again allocated to the Sedgefield constituency. 
4.1 First Periodical Review 
The first full periodical review followed in 1953-4 with the report published in 1954.21  This 
review divided the Gateshead constituency and altered the Jarrow constituency.  The 
remaining fifteen constituencies were unaltered.  These new boundaries were first used in 
the 1955 general election. 
4.2 Second Periodical Review 
The Second Periodical Review was published in 1969, having commenced in February 
1965.22  Since the previous review the county borough of Teesside had been created.  This 
covered the Redcar, Middlesborough, Stockton and Thornaby area and the borough was part 
of the North Riding of Yorkshire.  This meant Stockton was no longer considered part of 
Durham.  As a result the county was allocated one seat fewer than in the previous review, 
taking the county total to sixteen 
The Boundary Commission noted that a Royal Commission on local government in England 
was likely to make major changes to the Tyneside area so the Commission decided to make 
as little alteration as possible to the Parliamentary constituency boundaries in this review.  
The Darlington constituency was adjusted to realign the constituency boundaries with the 
borough boundaries, which had been altered in 1967.  The Boundary Commission report 
noted this as a minor change but gave no detail.  The area surrounding the Darlington 
constituency was transferred to the Bishop Auckland constituency following the abolition of 
the Sedgefield constituency. 
The 1969 recommendations were not implemented until after the 1970 general election, so 
the new boundaries were not used until the general elections of 1974. For more detail see 
Research Paper 92/61 The Parliamentary Boundary Commissions and the Boundary 
Commissions Bill.  
4.3 Third Periodical Review 
The next periodical review commenced in 1976, and the report was published in 1983.23  
Since the last review the Local Government Act 1972 had been implemented, which had 
altered many of the administrative boundaries across the country.  This had a significant 
impact on the county of Durham.  The Tyneside areas of Gateshead, Jarrow and South 
Shields, in the north of the county, were combined with Sunderland, Houghton and 
Washington and transferred to the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.  A new non-
metropolitan county of Cleveland was created southeast of Durham.  Hartlepool and the rural 
district of Stockton were transferred to Cleveland.  The remainder of the old county of 
Durham was combined with the rural district of Startforth, in the old North Riding Yorkshire, to 
create a new county of Durham.24

The Act also revised the local administrative structure within the modified county.  It defined 
the area covered by the county, but gave the Secretary of State for the Environment the 
power to define and name the new structure of local councils by order at a later date.  The 
municipal boroughs and rural districts were abolished and new districts were created using 
the definitions contained in the English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972.25  
The existing borough of Darlington was merged with part of the surrounding rural district to 
form the new borough of Darlington.26  New local electoral wards were then implemented in 
1976.27 
The Boundary Commission allocated the modified county seven constituencies.  The 
Boundary Commission initially recommended that the Darlington constituency should be 
enlarged to include three of the five rural wards that now formed part of the new borough of 
Darlington, Hurworth, Middleton St George, and Sadberge as they existed at the time.  
Following a local inquiry the proposal was dropped and the Darlington constituency was 
retained with the same boundaries as before and comprised all but five wards of the borough 
of Darlington.  The five rural wards of the borough of Darlington were instead allocated to the 
Sedgefield constituency re-established as a result of this review.  The new boundaries were 
implemented by order in 1983.28 They were used in the 1983, 1987 and 1992 general 
elections. 
4.4 Fourth Periodical Review 
The Fourth Periodical Review commenced in February 1991 and reported to Parliament in 
June 1995.29  Durham was allocated seven seats.  The Darlington constituency was 
unaltered by the review and continued to comprise all but five of the borough’s wards.  The 
five rural wards remained allocated to the Sedgefield constituency although there were 
boundary changes elsewhere in the Sedgefield constituency.  These boundaries were 
implemented by order in 199530, and used in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections. 
4.5 Fifth Periodical Review 
The Fifth Periodical Review of constituencies in England commenced in February 2000 and 
was published in February 2007.  The final recommendations adopted by the Commission 
and approved by Parliament were used at the 2010 general election. 
There had been two significant developments in the county by the time of the Fifth Review.  
All the local government districts of the county had been re-warded in 1999 along with those 
of Darlington in 2001.31  The Boundary Commission had to realign boundaries to take into 
account any alterations that had led to Parliamentary boundaries no longer being 
coterminous with ward boundaries.  In addition the Durham (Borough of Darlington) 
(Structural Changes) Order 1995 had created the new unitary authority of Darlington, which 
now had county status in its own right, and was no longer administratively part of the county 
of Durham.32

The Boundary Commission decided to review county Durham and Darlington together.  They 
noted that it would not affect the overall allocation of seats, but by reviewing the areas 
together the option of minimal changes would be available.  If Darlington had been reviewed 
as a separate review area this would have required greater disruption to Parliamentary 
boundaries. 
In the Darlington constituency the Boundary Commission recommended that there should be 
minimal realignment to the constituency boundaries to take into account the new ward 
boundaries.  This required two alterations.  The Harrowgate Hill ward had been enlarged to 
take in an area formerly in the Whessoe ward.  The Harrowgate ward remained allocated to 
the Darlington constituency which meant that 375 electors were transferred from the 
Sedgefield constituency to the Darlington constituency.  A new ward named Faverdale had 
been created and it too included an area formerly included in the Whessoe wards as well as 
including some of the old Cockerton East ward.  The Faverdale ward was allocated to the 
Darlington constituency which meant 295 electors were transferred to the Darlington 
constituency. 
A local inquiry into the proposals for Durham and Darlington was required.  The principal 
issue in relation to Darlington was whether Darlington should be reviewed separately or as 
part of the combined review area.  If Darlington was reviewed as a single area it would 
produce a single constituency coterminous with the borough.  The Assistant Commissioner 
conducting the inquiry reported that this would not necessarily produce an excessive 
disparity in the electorates of the constituencies in Durham and Darlington but there was 
significant approval for the Commission’s initial recommendations to keep the four rural 
wards of Darlington in the Sedgefield constituency (the ward restructuring had reduced the 
number of wards covering the rural parts of Darlington from five to four).  The Assistant 
Commissioner therefore recommended that the Commission’s initial proposals for Darlington 
should stand and be adopted as the final recommendation to be put to Parliament. 
The draft Order approving the Boundary Commission’s final recommendations was laid 
before Parliament on 26 February 2007 and was subject to the affirmative procedure. The 
House of Commons considered the draft Order on 27 March 2007 in the Fourth Delegated 
Legislation Committee33 and was formally approved by the House on 16 April 2007.34  The 
House of Lords approved the draft Order on 17 May 200735 with the approved Order being 
made on 13 June 2007 and coming into force 14 days after that.36  The full details of the 
provisional recommendations and the local inquiry can be viewed on an archive of the 
Boundary Commission website.37

No Fly Zones over Iraq
Standard Note: SN/IA/1981
Last updated: 13 March 2003
Author: Tim Youngs and Claire Taylor
International Affairs and Defence Section
N.B. The information contained in this Note is no longer current, following the fall of the
Saddam Hussein regime in April 2003. It provides historical information on the ‘no-fly
zones’ over northern and southern Iraq, which were imposed by the USA and UK in the
aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991. The Note looks at the legal basis cited by Washington
and London for the zones and summarises the main incidents that occurred between
September 2001 and March 2003.

D. Summary of Activity since 11 September 2001 8


2A. Background
The United States, the United Kingdom and France cited humanitarian reasons for the
establishment of the ‘no-fly zones’ over northern and southern Iraq, claiming the zones were
required to help protect the Kurdish and Shi\'ite populations from attack by Iraqi government
forces at the end of the Gulf War.
The northern zone north of the 36th parallel was introduced in April 1991 as part of Operation
Provide Comfort to provide humanitarian assistance to the Kurdish population in northern
Iraq. The no-fly zone operation, renamed Northern Watch in January 1997, involves
approximately 45 aircraft from the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.
Monitoring of the southern zone, called Operation Southern Watch, commenced in August
1992, to help protect the Shi’ite population of southern Iraq. The zone initially covered the
area south of the 32nd parallel. Following incursions by Iraqi forces into the Kurdish area in
1996, the zone was extended northwards to the 33rd parallel.
US and British aircraft currently patrol the southern zone, which covers approximately one-
third of Iraq. France refused to participate in patrolling north of the 32nd parallel and halted
all participation after Operation Desert Fox, the joint US-UK four-day campaign of air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998.
The zones restrict Iraqi military activity in the north and south of the country by keeping
aircraft grounded, hindering the deployment of air defence radars and surface-to-air missiles
and allowing the US and UK to monitor any large-scale deployments by Iraqi ground-forces.
Iraq rejects the zones, claiming they have no basis in UN Security Council Resolutions. An
Iraqi spokesman said on 5 January 1999:
Imposing the so-called no-fly zones is illegal…it is a flagrant violation of
international laws, norms and charters, particularly the UN Charter. Moreover, it is a
flagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions [which] underline the need to
respect Iraq\'s sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity.1
B. Debate over the Legal Basis
The precise legal basis of the zones is the subject of some debate. British and American
officials point to Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991, which demands that Iraq
end the repression of its civilian population and appeals to all Member States to contribute to
humanitarian relief efforts.2 Russia insists that the zones are not in fact backed by specific
resolutions, arguing that Resolution 688 was not adopted under Chapter VII of the UN
Charter, which concerns action with respect to threats to or breaches of international peace
1 BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 7 January 1999
2 S/RES/688 (1991)


3and security, and which allows the Security Council to authorise the use of force. London
and Washington hold that the zones remain of vital importance as a “necessary humanitarian
measure” to deter further internal repression by Baghdad.3 It is argued that the Iraqi
government’s record of internal repression, such as the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians
in 1988, underlines the importance of maintaining the zones.
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ben
Bradshaw, gave the following account of the no-fly zones in a Written Answer of 29 April
2002.
The no-fly zones were established in support of UNSCR 688. This called on Iraq to
end its brutal repression of Kurds and other minority groups in the north and of the
Shia community in the south. The no-fly zones were set up in response to a grave
humanitarian crisis and they prevent Saddam Hussein from once again using his air
power against the civilian population in those areas.4
The full text of Resolution 688 is reproduced below:
S/RES/0688 (1991)
5 April 1991
RESOLUTION 688 (1991)
Adopted by the Security Council at its 2982nd meeting on 5 April 1991
The Security Council,
Mindful of its duties and its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations
for the maintenance of international peace and security,
Recalling the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter of the United
Nations,
Gravely concerned by the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of
Iraq, including most recently in Kurdish populated areas, which led to a massive flow
of refugees towards and across international frontiers and to cross-border incursions,
which threaten international peace and security in the region,
Deeply disturbed by the magnitude of the human suffering involved,
Taking note of the letters sent by the representatives of Turkey and France to the
United Nations dated 2 April 1991 and 4 April 1991, respectively (S/22435 and
S/22442),
3 Financial Times, 2 February 1999
4 HC Deb 29 April 2002, c581-2w


4Taking note also of the letters sent by the Permanent Representative of the Islamic
Republic of Iran to the United Nations dated 3 and 4 April 1991, respectively
(S/22436 and S/22447),
Reaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of Iraq and of all States in the area,
Bearing in mind the Secretary-General\'s report of 20 March 1991 (S/22366),
1. Condemns the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq,
including most recently in Kurdish populated areas, the consequences of which
threaten international peace and security in the region;
2. Demands that Iraq, as a contribution to remove the threat to international peace and
security in the region, immediately end this repression and express the hope in the
same context that an open dialogue will take place to ensure that the human and
political rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected;
3. Insists that Iraq allow immediate access by international humanitarian
organizations to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq and to make
available all necessary facilities for their operations;
4. Requests the Secretary-General to pursue his humanitarian efforts in Iraq and to
report forthwith, if appropriate on the basis of a further mission to the region, on the
plight of the Iraqi civilian population, and in particular the Kurdish population,
suffering from the repression in all its forms inflicted by the Iraqi authorities;
5. Requests further the Secretary-General to use all the resources at his disposal,
including those of the relevant United Nations agencies, to address urgently the
critical needs of the refugees and displaced Iraqi population;
6. Appeals to all Member States and to all humanitarian organizations to contribute to
these humanitarian relief efforts;
7. Demands that Iraq cooperate with the Secretary-General to these ends;
8. Decides to remain seized of the matter.5

5C. Operations in the No-Fly Zones
In a Written Answer on 17 December 1998, the then Secretary of State for Defence, George
Robertson, stated:
Since patrolling of the northern and southern Iraqi No-Fly-Zones began…the RAF
have flown some 15,500 sorties in the zones.6
In a further Written Answer on 5 June 2000, the then Parliamentary Under Secretary for
Defence, John Spellar, outlined specific figures for the following year:
Between April 1999 and March 2000 RAF aircraft flew a total of 2,683 sorties in the
no-fly zones; 450 in the northern no-fly zone and 2,233 in the southern no-fly zone.7
With regard to American involvement in the no-fly zones, Lt. Col. Phillip Gibbons of the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote on 1 July 2002 that:
Since 1991, the United States has averaged over 34,000 military sorties per year in
support of no-fly zone operations in Iraq.8
The cost to the UK of enforcing the individual no-fly zones was outlined in a Written Answer
on 16 February 1999 by the then Secretary of State for Defence, George Robertson:
Enforcement of the northern and southern no-fly-zones over Iraq began in 1991 and
1992 respectively. The annual additional costs of each operation since that time are as
follows:

6(1) The figures for 1998-99 are estimates. The southern no-fly-zone estimate for this
year takes account of the deployment of RAF aircraft to Kuwait as well as Saudi
Arabia.9
However, beyond 1999 more precise figures are unavailable. The Minister for the Armed
Forces, Adam Ingram, stated in a Written Answer on 7 November 2002:
Our records do not separately identify expenditure incurred in maintaining the no fly
zones. However, the table below sets out the overall additional expenditure incurred
by the Ministry of Defence as a direct result of operations in the Gulf from 1992-1993
onwards.

Since 1998 there has been an increase in military activity by coalition aircraft operating in the
northern and southern no-fly zones. The United States European Command has stated:
Coalition aircraft have been enforcing the northern no-fly-zone for more than 10
years. Since December 1998, Saddam Hussein has opted to challenge this
enforcement by firing at coalition aircraft with surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and
anti-aircraft artillery and by targeting them with radar…aircraft respond in self-
defence to these threats, while continuing to enforce the no-fly-zones.11

7Since the end of February 2003 there has been a marked increase in allied activity in the no-
fly zones, which has prompted many analysts and commentators to suggest that the no-fly
zones are being used by the US and UK to launch pre-emptive strikes ahead of a possible
conflict.
An article in The Guardian, commented:
Britain and the United States have all but fired the first shots of the second Gulf War
by dramatically extending the range of targets in the no-fly zones over Iraq to soften
up the country for an allied ground invasion […]
Analysts confirm that there has been an intensification of what is known as “the
undeclared war” […]
Loren Thompson, a defence analyst with the US Lexington Institute, told Reuters:
“The US military is taking advantage of the no-fly zones to prepare the battlespace
for war. There’s been a sporadic war occurring in the air over Iraq for a dozen years
now. This merely ratchets up the intensity”.12
In response to these allegations the Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, stated during
Oral Questions on 3 March 2003:
As I said a few moments ago, our forces have been undertaking more frequent patrols
in the no-fly zones with a broader range of aircraft. However, I assure my hon. Friend
that they do that in response to efforts to attack them and act entirely in self-defence,
in accordance with international law […] the arrangements for patrolling the southern
and northern no-fly zones remain unchanged. As he would expect, our forces are
authorised to deal with any threats that Iraqi forces pose to them.13

Research Paper 96/102
8 November 1996
The Firearms (Amendment) Bill [Bill 10 of 1996-97] will be debated on Second Reading on
November 12 1996. This paper considers the background to and provisions of the Bill, which
arises from measures proposed by the Government in response to the report of The Public
Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 Cm 3386. The
inquiry was chaired by Lord Cullen and published on October 16 1996. The Bill does not
extend to Northern Ireland.

Summary
The Firearms (Amendment) Bill [Bill 10 of 1996-97] is designed to implement proposals set
out in the Government\'s response to the report of the public inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen
into the shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996. The intention behind the
Bill is to ban handguns above .22 calibre and permit members of the public to own handguns
taking .22 rimfire cartridges, provided that these are stored in secure conditions in gun clubs
licensed under new procedures. There will be limited exemptions for certain categories of
people, including vets who need to put down animals humanely, people who work in
slaughterhouses, race officials at athletic meetings and people with trophies of war obtained
before 1946. Other provisions in the Bill are also aimed at tightening the current certification
procedures carried out by the police, placing the onus on individuals to satisfy the police that
they are fit to hold a firearm safely and giving the police powers to revoke certificates where
they consider that the applicant no longer has good reason for possessing a firearm. The Bill
also contains provisions brought forward by the Government in addition to those covered by
Lord Cullen, including a ban on expanding ammunition except for the purposes of lawfully
shooting deer and vermin control, a curb on mail order sales of firearms and a requirement
for gun owners to inform the police if they buy, sell, destroy, transfer or de-activate any gun.
This paper sets out a brief history of gun control in this country and goes on to describe the
current controls and certification procedures under the Firearms Act 1968 as amended and
how these will be affected by the Bill. It also explains the current approval procedures for gun
clubs and the provisions in the Bill under which the clubs will have to be licensed.
The Government has said that compensation will be paid to owners of guns which are to be
prohibited by the Bill, based on the market value of the guns before October 16th 1996.
Licensed firearms dealers will also be compensated for stocks of prohibited weapons which
they wish to surrender.This paper discusses the question of compensation for firearms and the
use of firearms amnesties.
It has been asserted by some commentators that the Bill of Rights 1689 may affect statutory
attempts at gun control. This paper considers these assertions and the wider discussion about
the current status of the 1689 Bill. 
This paper includes a brief summary of controls on firearms in Northern Ireland, although the
Firearms (Amendment ) Bill does not extend there.

Research Paper 96/102
A. Brief outline of the history of the control of firearms in Great
Britain
Before the Firearms Act 1920, there was virtually no control over the sale and possession of
guns. In his evidence to the Home Affairs Committee in 1996, the specialist adviser, Mr
Colin Greenwood, commented that:1
During the early part of this century anyone, respectable citizen, criminal or lunatic, could
walk into a gunshop and buy any firearm he wanted. The law prohibited sales to persons who
were drunk at the time, and those wishing to buy a pistol would have been required to call
first at a post office to obtain a 10 shilling licence. Despite that, statistics provided by the
Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis showed that the use of it in crime was very rare
indeed.
The 1920 Act, passed at a time of concern about the quantities of weapons available after the
first World War, made it an offence to buy, possess, use or carry rifles and pistols or their
ammunition without a certificate from a chief officer of police, who had to be sure that an
applicant had a good reason for acquiring the firearm and could be permitted to have it
without danger to public safety. The Firearms Amendment Act 1936 strengthened
arrangements for the issue of certificates by enabling conditions to be attached to them;
brought weapons such as short-barrelled shot guns within the control and prescribed stringent
controls on continuous fire weapons such as machine guns. Shotguns remained outside the
system of controls.
In 1962 the Air Guns and Shot Guns Etc. Act restricted the use of such weapons by young
persons. The Firearms Act 1965, described by Mr Greenwood as "...clearly a panic reaction
to the abolition of the death penalty"2, substantially increased the penalties for offences
involving firearms and created new offences of carrying firearms in public places or while
trespassing.
Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 made it an offence to buy or possess a shot gun
without a certificate issued by a chief officer of police, but there was no requirement to have
a good reason for wanting one. This, and all previous legislation on the control of firearms
in England, Scotland and Wales was consolidated in the Firearms Act 1968.

Research Paper 96/102
In 1973, a consultative document was issued by the Home Office which made wide-ranging
proposals based on the report of Sir John McKay\'s working party set up in 1970. Mr
Greenwood, in his memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee, commented that the first
conclusion of the unpublished report that a reduction in the number of firearms in private
hands was a desirable end in itself, was not included in the green paper.3
This proposed that self-loading rifles and pump-action and repeater shot guns should be
moved into the prohibited category and that additions should be able to be made by order;
that another order-making power should be introduced to achieve greater consistency in
deciding what was a good reason for possessing "Section 1" firearms, but the most far-
reaching of suggested changes were those relating to shot guns which, it proposed, should be
subject to the same controls as rifles and pistols under s.1 of the 1968 Act. The proposal met
with considerable opposition from the shooting community and time was not found for the
necessary legislation.
In 1987, the tragic events at Hungerford which resulted in the deaths of 16 people killed by
a single gunman precipitated further consideration of changes to the 1968 Act. The gunman,
Michael Ryan, was lawfully entitled to posses the following self-loading weapons:4
Beretta 9 mm pistol
Bernadelli .22 pistol
CZ OR50 .32 pistol
Kalashnikov 7.62 mm rifle
Underwood Carbine .30 rifle
The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 provided, inter alia
 a prohibition on high powered self-loading rifles
 a prohibition on burst fire weapons and repeating short barrelled smooth bore guns
 that pump action and self-loading short guns with a magazine capacity in excess of 2 shots
be brought under the same control as rifles and pistols 
 that prohibited weapons converted from a higher classification to a lower one, should retain
the original higher classification.

possess a shotgun without danger to the public safety or the peace and

 the power for the chief officer to refuse to grant or renew a certificate if satisfied that the
applicant did not have good reason for possessing a shotgun.
The Firearms Rules 1989, SI 1989/854 set out inter alia new requirements for the safekeeping
of shotguns, as did the Firearms (Scotland) Rules in Scotland, SI 1989/889. S.22 of the Act
established a firearms consultative committee to keep under review the working of the
Firearms Acts.
The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1994 created new criminal offences of using a firearm or
imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and made it clear that the offence of
trespassing with a firearm can be committed when using an imitation firearm.
The controls in Northern Ireland imposed by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 are
described on p.77.

B. Controls on Firearms - Part I of the Bill
1. General Principles, Definitions and Current Controls
The underlying purpose of firearms legislation in the UK is to control the supply and
possession of all rifles, guns and pistols which could be used for criminal or subversive
purposes while recognising that individuals may own and use firearms for legitimate purposes.
The possession of pistols, revolvers, rifles and ammunition for these weapons has required
a police firearm certificate since the implementation of the Firearms Act 1920 and shotguns
have required a police certificate since 1967. Machine guns have been prohibited wapons
since 1937. The principal Act in England and Wales and Scotland is the Firearms Act 1968,
as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and others. 
For the purposes of the Firearms Acts 1968-1992, "firearm" means "a lethal barrelled weapon
of any description from which any shot, bullet or missile can be discharged..."5 The Firearms
Act 1982 extended the definition of "firearm" to include some imitation firearms. 
Controls of varying degrees are placed on four broad categories of weapons under the
Firearms Acts. These categories are: 
Prohibited Weapons
Some types of weapon and ammunition are prohibited altogether and may only lawfully be
held in someone\'s possession, purchased, acquired, manufactured, sold or transferred with the
authority of the Secretary of State. The full list is set out in Section 5(1) of the Firearms Act
1968 as follows:
(a) any firearm which is so designed or adapted that two or more missiles
can be successively discharged without repeated pressure on the
trigger;
(ab) any self-loading or pump-action rifle other than one which is
chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges;
(ac) any self-loading or pump-action smooth-bore gun which is not
chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges and either has a barrel less than
24 inches in length or (excluding any detachable, folding, retractable
or other movable butt-stock) is less than 40 inches in length overall;
                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 Firearms Act 1968 Section 57 (i)
10


Research Paper 96/102
(ad) any smooth-bore revolver gun other than one which is chambered for
9 mm rim-fire cartridges or loaded at the muzzle end of each chamber;
(ae) any rocket launcher, or any mortar, for projecting a stabilised missile,
other than a launcher or mortar designed for line-throwing or
pyrotechnic purposes or as signalling apparatus;
(b) any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the
discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing; and
[(c) any cartridge with a bullet designed to explode on or immediately
before impact, any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to
contain any such noxious thing as is mentioned in paragraph (b) above
and, if capable of being used with a firearm of any description, any
grenade, bomb (or other like missile), or rocket or shell designed to
explode as aforesaid].
Paragraphs a)-ae) and paragraph c) of this subsection were introduced by the Firearms
(Amendment) Act 1988 in the wake of the massacre at Hungerford in the summer of 1987.
Under Section 5A of the 1968 Act the possession, purchase, acquisition, sale or transfer of
certain weapons is prohibited without the authority of the Secretary of State unless these
activities come within the terms of a certificate authorising such activities for the purpose of
maintaining, keeping or exhibiting the weapons as part of a collection. The weapons and
ammunition covered by this provision are as follows:
(a) any firearm which is disguised as another object;
(b) any rocket or ammunition not falling within paragraph (c) of
subsection (1)of this section which consists in or incorporates a missile
designed to explode on or immediately before impact and is for
military use;
(c) any launcher or other projecting apparatus not falling within paragraph
(ae) of that subsection which is designed to be used with any rocket
or ammunition falling within paragraph (b) above or with ammunition
which would fall within that paragraph but for its being ammunition
falling with paragraph (c) of that subsection;
(d) any ammunition for military use which consists in or incorporates a
missile designed so that a substance contained in the missile will ignite
on or immediately before impact;
(e) any ammunition for military use which consists in or incorporates a
missile designed, on account of its having a jacket and hard-core, to
penetrate armour plating, armour screening or body armour;
11


Research Paper 96/102
(f) any ammunition which is designed to be used with a pistol and
incorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact;
(g) anything which is designed to be projected as a missile from any
weapon and is designed to be, or has been, incorporated in
(i) any ammunition falling within any of the preceding paragraphs; or
(ii) any ammunition which would fall within any of those paragraphs
but for it being specified in subsection (1) of this section.
Weapons not subject to controls.
At the other end of the spectrum, some types of weapon do not require a certificate at all.
These include air guns, other than those of a type which have been declared by rules made
by the Secretary of State under Section 53 of the 1968 Act to be particularly dangerous. The
sale or hire of air weapons to those under the age of 17 is, however prohibited under the
Firearms Act 1968. Young people under the age of 14 may not buy, hire or be given or own
an air weapon and may use one only if they are supervised by someone who is 21 or over.
Shotguns 
Section 1(3) of the 1968 Act as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 defines a
"shotgun" as follows:
(a) a shot gun within the meaning of this Act, that is to say a smooth-
bore gun (not being an air gun) which-
(i) has a barrel not less than 24 inches in length and does not have
any barrel with a bore exceeding 2 inches in diameter;
(ii) either has no magazine or has a non-detachable magazine
incapable of holding more than two cartridges; and
(iii) is not a revolver gun
Under Section 2 of the 1968 Act it is an offence for a person to possess, purchase or acquire
shotguns or ammunition for shotguns except within the terms of a shotgun certificate issued
by the chief officer of police for the area in which the person resides.
Firearms
These are lethal barrelled weapons of any description from which any shot, bullet or missile
can be discharged."6 other than those which come within the other three categories of weapon.
                                                                                                                                                                                            
6 Firearms Act 1968 Section 57 (i)
12


Research Paper 96/102
Rifles, pistols, revolvers and other types of handguns are the principal weapons coming within
this category. Section 1 of the 1968 Act makes it an offence for a person to possess, purchase
or acquire firearms or ammunition for firearms except within the terms of a firearm
certificate issued by the chief officer of police for the area in which the person resides.
"Handguns"
In its report on the Possession of Handguns, published on July 24 1996 the Home Affairs
Committee noted that:7
Handguns: a definition
5. The word "handgun" is not a term used in legislation, but may be seen as a generic term
covering all smaller guns (generally pistols) designed to be fired from the hands rather than
from the shoulder. Pistols may be:
(i) automatic, in which case the weapon will fire continuously so long as ammunition
is fed to it and pressure is applied to the trigger: we note that, contrary to
widespread belief, these weapons are already banned;
(ii) semi-automatic, in which case separate trigger actions are required in order to fire
each shot, but ammunition is fed to the chamber automatically from a magazine;
(iii) revolvers, in which case ammunition is loaded into a revolving cylinder usually
containing up to six rounds; or
(iv) single-shot, in which case the pistol has to be reloaded manually for each shot.
Exemptions from the certification requirement
The Firearms Act 1968 provides exemptions from the need to hold a firearm or shotgun
certificate in some circumstances. These tend to exempt a person in particular circumstances
in respect of firearms held, purchased or acquired for some particular and specified purpose.
Exemptions in these sorts of terms include those for:
i) people who have obtained police permits (Section 7);
ii) authorised firearms dealers and people in business as carriers, auctioneers or
warehousemen for the possession of firearms or ammunition in the ordinary course of their
businesses (Sections 8 and 9);

Research Paper 96/102
iii) people licensed to slaughter animals, for the possession of firearms in the
slaughterhouses or knacker\'s yards in which they are employed, and the proprietors of such
establishments, or people appointed by them to take charge of slaughtering instruments, for
the purpose of keeping them in safe storage for the possession of firearms for that purpose
(Section 10);
iv) firearms used in theatrical performances and film production, on board ships and aircraft,
in certain specified circumstances (Sections 12 and 13);
v) firearms used in sports, athletics and other approved activities, as provided by Section
11 of the 1968 Act :
(1) A person carrying a firearm or ammunition belonging to another
person holding a certificate under this Act may, without himself holding
such a certificate, have in his possession that firearm or ammunition under
instructions from, and for the use of, that other person for sporting purposes
only.
(2) A person may, without holding a certificate, have a firearm in his
possession at an athletic meeting for the purpose of starting races at that
meeting.
(3) A member of a ... cadet corps approved by the Secretary of State
may, without holding a certificate, have in his possession a firearm and
ammunition when engaged as a member of the ... corps in, or in connection
with, drill or target practice.
(4) A person conducting or carrying on a miniature rifle range (whether
for a rifle club or otherwise) or shooting gallery at which no firearms are
used other than air weapons or miniature rifles not exceeding .23 inch
calibre may, without holding a certificate, have in his possession, or
purchase or acquire, such miniature rifles and ammunition suitable therefor;
and any person may, without holding a certificate, use any such rifle and
ammunition at such a range or gallery.
(5) A person may, without holding a shot gun certificate, borrow a shot
gun from the occupier of private premises and use it on those premises in
the occupier\'s presence.
(6) A person may, without holding a shot gun certificate, use a shot gun
at a time and place approved for shooting at artificial targets by the chief
officer of police for the area in which that place is situated.
Section 16 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 also provides that:
16 Borrowed rifles on private premises
(1) A person of or over the age of seventeen may, without holding a
firearm certificate, borrow a rifle from the occupier of private premises and
14


Research Paper 96/102
use it on those premises in the presence either of the occupier or of a
servant of the occupier if-
(a) the occupier or servant in whose presence it is used holds a
firearm certificate in respect of that rifle; and
(b) the borrower\'s possession and use of it complies with any
conditions as to those matters specified in the certificate.
(2) A person who by virtue of subsection (1) above is entitled without
holding a firearm certificate to borrow and use a rifle in another person\'s
presence may also, without holding such a certificate, purchase or acquire
ammunition for use in the rifle and have it in his possession during the
period for which the rifle is borrowed if-
(a) the firearm certificate held by that other person authorises the
holder to have in his possession at that time ammunition for
the rifle of a quantity not less than that purchased or acquired
by, and in the possession of, the borrower; and
(b) the borrower\'s possession and use of the ammunition complies
with any conditions as to those matters specified in the
certificate.
"Private premises" in these Sections of the 1968 and 1988 Acts includes land. Under Section
7 of the Firearms Act 1968 a person may obtain a permit from the chief officer of police for
the area in which he resides which will enable him to possess a firearm and ammunition for
a specified purpose without holding a certificate under the 1968 Act. Section 17 of the
Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 also allows a visitor to Great Britain who has obtained a
visitors\' permit from a chief officer of police in this country to possess a firearm and purchase
or acquire ammunition, or possess a shotgun and purchase or acquire shotguns without the
need for a firearm or shotgun certificate.
The evidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to
Lord Cullen\'s Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane Primary School describes the uses of
firearms as follows:
9. Aside from the police and military, firearms and shot guns have both occupational and
leisure uses and there is a substantial shooting community in Great Britain. Shotguns are used
for game shooting, rough shooting, shooting artificial moving targets such as clay pigeons and
by farmers and farm workers for shooting vermin.
10. Use of rifles is generally confined to target shooting and deer stalking although one
particular type (.22 inch rimfire) has a long-established use in pest control on agricultural land.
Handguns such as revolvers and pistols are generally only used for target shooting, either at
traditional bullseye targets or in \'practical shooting\' which involves firing at multiple and
possibly moving targets to time limits. But they too have occupational uses, for example
among veterinary surgeons and others who may need to destroy seriously wounded animals
quickly and humanely.
15


Research Paper 96/102
11. Most shooting  clubs have a firing range of their own or regular access to one, and
competitive target shooting is a well established sport. It is generally organised under the
auspices of one of the national shooting organisations, in particular the National Rifle
Association, National Small-bore Rifle Association and National Pistol Association.
12. The ranges at Bisley, Surrey, recognised by the Sports Council as the national shooting
centre, have occupied a prominent place in the shooting sports, both at home and abroad, for
many years. A number of target shooting disciplines are recognised Olympic events and
British marksmen have distinguished themselves internationally over the years.
2. Proposals to Restrict the Availability of Firearms
Following the massacre at Dunblane Primary School on March 21 1996 the Government set
up a Tribunal of Inquiry under Lord Cullen to inquire into the circumstances leading up to
and surrounding the events at Dunblane, to consider the issues arising from those events, to
make interim and final recommendations and to report as soon as practicable. The report of
The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 19968 was
duly published on October 16 1996. In his report, Lord Cullen recommended that:9
24. Consideration should be given to restricting the availability of self-
loading pistols and revolvers of any calibre which are held by individuals for
use in target shooting
preferably, by their disablement, while they are not in use, by either
(i) the removal of the slide assembly/cylinder, which is to be kept
securely on the premises of an approved club of which the owner is
a member or by a club official; or (ii) the fitting of a locked barrel
block by a club official (para 9.112);
or, if such a system is not adopted, by the banning of the possession of such
handguns by individual owners (para 9.113).
Lord Cullen set out the rationale behind this approach in Chapter 9 of his report. He noted
the "entrenched attitude" of the shooting community\'s representatives at the Inquiry, who
were, he said, " opposed in principle to any restriction on the availability of handguns."10 Lord
Cullen also referred to the role of Government and Parliament in deciding questions of policy
in relation to the availability of handguns and other firearms:11
9.111 At the same time l am very conscious that proposals such as a ban on
the possession of a certain type of firearm raise questions which are
peculiarly within the province of the Government and Parliament to decide.
Thus after the shootings at Hungerford in August 1987. the Government
decided how far there should be, in "the words of the White Paper, a shift

Research Paper 96/102
in the balance of controls \'between safeguarding the public at large and
protecting, the interests of the legitimate shooting community" (Firearms Act
1968: Proposals for Reform, para 4.) Michael Ryan had killed half of his
victims with shots from a self-loading pistol and the fact that handguns
posed particular dangers was recognised (Green Book Part 11, para 11).
However, the Government did not propose that handguns should be banned.
The proposal of such a ban after the shootings at Dunblane once more raises
a question of policy. It is necessary to decide what risk is acceptable,
bearing in mind that some risk is an inevitable feature of daily life. Against
the risk to society has to be balanced the loss of freedom of the individual
and the other implications which I mentioned earlier (paras 9.100-9.105).
There may also be competing claims on the use of resources. In the light
of these points it is clear to me that in stating my own conclusions I should
confine myself to what I recommend should be considered.
Lord Cullen said that if for any reason the course he recommended was not followed he saw
no alternative to considering the "more draconian alternative" of a ban on multi-shot
handguns. He added that:12
However. in such circumstances I would suggest that the ban should be
directed to the possession of such handguns by individual owners rather than
the possession of handguns by shooting clubs, since it is through possession
by individuals that the risk, in so far as there is a risk, of homicide or
serious injury arises. Thus I do not consider that the banning of handguns
for target shooting or the banning of shooting clubs would be justified. I
have no particular recommendation as to the legislative means by which
effect would be given to such a ban.
Lord Cullen set out the arguments which had been presented to him concerning a total ban
on guns and his view of those arguments as follows:13
7.12 At this point I turn to consider the submission made by Mr C M
Campbell QC who represented the families of the deceased children, the
injured children, the children who were absent from class and Mrs Harrild
and Mrs Blake. I take this submission first since it would have as its logical
consequence the ending of the certification system for any category of
firearm. It follows therefore that I should deal with it before going further
into the questions which I have posed in the last two paragraphs.
7.13 Mr Campbell emphasised at the outset that Thomas Hamilton\'s actions
had thrown into relief the dangers to society of there being many people
armed with "weapons designed to kill" and able to accomplish this with
rapid and clinical efficiency. The time had come for radical change. There
should be "a complete ban on the civilian ownership, possession and use of
all types of gun". In support of that submission he put forward the
                                                                                                                                                                                            
12 ibid para 9.113 
13 Cm 3386 p.81-83

Research Paper 96/102
following. First, even with the most thorough safeguards, the potential for
another Dunblane would remain. Mistakes would occur. Second, there was
always a conflict or tension between limited resources on the one hand and
the need for a rigorous system of control on the other. Third, there was a
tension between a police force seeking to regulate the shooting community
and a police force which was under pressure to provide a good service to the
same people. It could not be ensured that public safety would always be the
paramount consideration. Fourth, there was always a potential for an
individual\'s circumstances to change in such a way that danger arose where
none existed before. The current firearms laws were not designed to cope
with the present relatively large number of urban residents who possessed
semiautomatic handguns for no reason other than target shooting. Fifth, the
current system and the existence of shooting clubs would continue to
introduce many thousands of people to guns over the years people who
otherwise would not be familiar with them. Not all of them were of
impeccable character. Some were attracted by the guns themselves, their
supposed glamour and their boost to the ego. Sixth, there was, he said, an
apparently well-established link between access to guns and the rate of gun-
crimes and gun-suicides.
7.14 Mr Campbell added that the debate should not be influenced by any
supposed inherent right to hold guns. A safety-first philosophy should be
adopted and this pointed to radical change. Any decision to continue to
permit lawful possession of firearms necessarily implied a willingness to
tolerate an increased rate of gun-crime and gun-suicide. It might be thought
that the shooting community "do themselves few favours by their apparent
reluctance to countenance any material change".
7.15 The BSSC in their final written submission pointed out that no
witness at the Inquiry. with the exception of Mr McMurdo, the former
Deputy Chief Constable of Central Scotland Police, suggested such a
prohibition. They pointed out that the Dunblane Snowdrop Petition stopped
short of such a call. in submitting that all firearms held for recreational
purposes for use in authorised sporting clubs should be held securely at such
clubs with the firm, mechanisms removed. and that the private ownership of
handguns be made illegal. The BSSC maintained that there was no
convincing evidence that if Thomas Hamilton had been denied lawful access
to firearms. he would not have found and used some other means to carry
out his premeditated plans, or been able in a relatively short space of time
to acquire a firearm and ammunition from the "vast stock of illegally-held
guns in circulation". They drew attention to the statement in the Green
Book (Part II. paras 4 and 6) that such a prohibition would be unprecedented
in a democratic country and would have very serious consequences.
including adverse economic impact. Mr Mark Scoggins, who appeared for
the BSSC during closing submissions. observed that even if a tension existed
between a duty to regulate and a pressure to provide a service it was not in
any way unique to target shooting. He instanced to position of other
regulators such as the Health and Safety Executive. The general function
of the police was to provide a service to the community. Even if there was
a potential conflict or tension, the solution was to combine firmness with
fairness. It was not correct to depict firearms laws as out of joint with the
scale of firearm-ownership in modern times. Evidence had been given as
18


Research Paper 96/102
to the large number of guns in private ownership before the first legislation
in 1920. The assertion that the shooting community had done itself few
favours overlooked the fact that their position was that "at the centre is the
individual not guns". In that respect they had made a number of proposals.
Sound reasons had been given for not adopting various means of control
over guns which had been suggested. Mr C N McEachran QC who
appeared for the Scottish Target Shooting Federation drew my attention to
submissions which had challenged the assertion that there was a link
between the availability of guns and the rate of gun-crime.
7.16 The submission made by Mr Campbell is of such width that it would
embrace not merely handguns. with which the Inquiry was directly
concerned. but also rifles, shot guns and air weapons: and would admit of
no exceptions. It would prevent the use of guns for occupational purposes
such as shot guns used for shooting game and vermin, rifles for deer
stocking and pest control: and handguns for humane disposal of seriously
injured animals, slaughtering of animals and signalling the start of races at
athletic meetings. No doubt it would be possible to devise a system of
exceptions which could be grafted on to a wholesale prohibition.
However, the more fundamental point is that the range of uses for these
types of guns is very different. Thus the considerations relating to the
possession and use of shotguns are concerned with very different areas of
activity from those relating to handguns. I am not persuaded that it is
justifiable to approach all these types in essentially the same manner. That
is quite apart from the fact that I do not consider that the availability of shot
guns is a matter which has a tenable connection with the circumstances with
which this Inquiry is concerned.
7.17 For these reasons I do not recommend that such a wholesale prohibition
should be considered. However, that is not to say that I will not have to
look at the case for restricting, the availability of certain firearms with which
the Inquiry is concerned. In doing so I will have to take account of
arguments which I have summarised above, as well as many more besides.
He also made the following remarks about the banning of the possession by individuals of
multi-shot handguns:14
9.95 This is the course of action which is advocated by ACOPS in the
form of a recommendation that "all multi-shot pistols be raised to the
prohibited category" , ie so that they would fall within section 5 of the 1968
Act. However, as Chief Constable Cameron explained in evidence, ACOPS
envisaged that the Secretary of State would authorise such handguns to be
possessed by shooting clubs where they would be stored. Both ACOPS and
ACPO recommend that the handguns in respect of which firearm certificates
may be granted for target shooting should be restricted to a single shot and
to .22 calibre. The Police Federation of England and Wales advocate that
the private possession of all handguns should be banned. It may be noted

Research Paper 96/102
that the position of ACPO has changed since the hearing before the Home
Affairs Committee on 8 May. At that time their position was that a
prohibition on the licensed possession of handguns was impracticable.
Given ACPO\'s views to the Committee Mr Sharples acknowledged that
Great Britain featured in national/international, European and Olympic
events and that the use of handguns in connection with that sporting interest
was extensive. A complete ban of handguns would cause significant
difficulties for a very substantial law-abiding element in the country who
pursued quite proper sporting activities (Q19).
9.96 The practicability of such a measure was not questioned save in one
respect. It was suggested that the EC Weapons Directive (91/447/EEC)
would prevent the implementation of such a ban. This Directive provided
for the partial harmonisation of Member States\' domestic firearms controls
in order to reach consistency in regard to minimum standards. However, it
allows Member States to maintain or introduce domestic controls which are
more stringent than those standards. provided that the European Commission
and other Member States are advised accordingly. Thus, as I understand the
position, the Directive does not prevent this country from introducing such
a ban. The Directive is due to be reviewed by the European Commission
by the end of 1997. This will provide an opportunity for the Government
to put its case for altering any of the prohibitions which apply to all Member
States if it sees a case for so doing.
9.97 As I have already indicated in the first part of the chapter it was
questioned whether any restriction on the legal availability of firearms would
be effective. It was suggested that the owners of handguns which were
currently in lawful possession might avoid confiscation by causing them to
"disappear". Examples of this phenomenon were drawn by some
commentators from the past history of firearms control in this country and
in Germany. Even if the withdrawal of lawfully held handguns was
achieved, professional criminals and others who were bent on mischief could
obtain illegal handguns. Further there was a risk that by process of
"displacement" they might resort to the use of other types of firearm, such
as shot guns, which were capable of delivering shots which were more
devastating, or to other methods of destruction such as bombs. There was
nothing to suggest that the banning of self-loading rifles under the 1988 Act
(which had led to the confiscation of Thomas Hamilton\'s rifle) had prevented
the happening of anything that was worse than occurred. The same points
also apply to the proposal that the handguns in respect of which firearm
certificates may be granted for target shooting should be restricted to .22
calibre.
9.98 None of these points can be dismissed from consideration. However
given that lawfully held handguns are identified in firearm certificates, the
opportunity for them to "disappear" is much less than if they were not
identified at all. I have already rejected the contention that legally held
firearms are of no significance in regard to the commission of crime, and
expressed the view that the arguments in support of weapon substitution are
overstated. I am not convinced that a restriction on the availability of
handguns would actually lead to an increase in injury. I am satisfied that
a ban on the possession of multi-shot handguns would have some effect on
20


Research Paper 96/102
the incidence of serious crime.
In its response to Lord Cullen\'s Report the Government said it intended to go further than
Lord Cullen had suggested and prohibit all higher calibre handguns. It also proposed to
prohibit people from keeping even single shot handguns at home:15
As recommended by Lord Cullen the Government has considered restricting
the availability of self-loading hand guns. It has given careful consideration
to Lord Cullen\'s suggestions, which fall into two parts. It has concluded that
neither would provide an acceptable level of public safety. 
First of all he has suggested two methods by which hand guns might be
disabled. The first involves the removal of key components from the gun.
While removal of key components is feasible for certain types of guns, it is
not a practical proposition for others. Alternatively, Lord Cullen has
indicated that weapons might be disabled by fitting a locked "barrel block"
to the gun. He recognised however that such devices are currently
manufactured only for shot guns. Even if they were available, the Forensic
Science Service-which advises the Government on the technical aspects of
firearms including their deactivation-is not convinced that a barrel block or
similar device could not be removed by a determined individual and the
Government does not, therefore, believe that it could rely on such a measure.
Lord Cullen\'s second suggestion is that if guns cannot be disabled,
consideration should be given to banning the possession of self-loading
pistols and revolvers by individuals. In the light of this the Government has
decided to legislate early in the next session of Parliament to ban all hand
guns of more than .22 calibre including those used by Thomas Hamilton.
This will mean that at least 160,000 guns-80% of those legally held at
present-will be destroyed. All hand guns chambered for .22 rimfire
ammunition, including single shot guns, will also be banned unless they are
kept in licensed gun clubs under conditions of the most stringent security.
This means that, in two important respects, the Government intends to go
further than Lord Cullen\'s proposals: by banning all higher calibre handguns;
and by prohibiting people from keeping even single shot handguns at home.
In his statement to the House on the day the Cullen report and the Government\'s response to
it were published the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, set out the Government\'s legislative
intentions in relation to handguns as follows:16
I come to the question that I know will be of
greatest concern to the House and the nation: the
controls on the ownership of handguns. Lord
Cullen confines his suggestions to self-loading
pistols and revolvers of all calibres. He does not
consider that further restrictions are required for

Research Paper 96/102
single-shot handguns, which he would allow to be
kept in the home, as at present. He suggests that
owners of multi-shot guns should be required to
disable them when keeping them at home, and goes
on to say that, if after consideration those
arrangements are found not to be practicable, there
should instead be a ban on the possession of multi-
shot handguns by individual owners. He envisages
that it would still be possible for guns to be kept by
a club secretary so that target shooting could
continue, using guns owned by the club.
The Government have taken advice from the
Forensic Science Service on the practicability of
Lord Cullen\'s suggestions for disabling handguns.
Lord Cullen himself recognised that there were
considerable practical difficulties in removing key
components from handguns. The Forensic Science
Service has confirmed that view. It is also not
convinced that a barrel block-Lord Cullen\'s other
suggestion-could be made that someone with
sufficient determination and access to metal-
working tools could not remove. As a result, I
have come to the conclusion that we cannot
recommend that approach to the House.
I therefore come to Lord Cullen\'s alternative
suggestion of banning multi-shot handguns from
individual ownership. I propose to go considerably
further than Lord Cullen has suggested in two
respects. First, we shall ban all handguns from
people\'s homes. I do not agree with Lord Cullen
that it would be safe to allow single-shot handguns
to remain in the home. I believe that they should
be subject to the same controls as those imposed on
multi-shot handguns.
Secondly, we shall outlaw high-calibre
handguns of the kind used by Thomas Hamilton.
Low-calibre handguns-.22 rimfire handguns-will
have to be used and kept in licensed clubs. We
believe that a distinction needs to be made between
high-calibre handguns, which are principally made
for police and military use, and .22 rimfire
handguns, which are largely intended for target
shooting. Although Lord Cullen decided against
making such a distinction, he sets out in paragraph
9.49 of his report a table that demonstrates that a
.22 handgun is some four to six times less powerful
than higher-calibre handguns.
In paragraph 9.44, Lord Cullen points out that
the expansion in the use of high-calibre handguns
has even made many shooters concerned about the
use of such guns symbols of personal power. In
addition, target shooting with .22 handguns has
been an Olympic sport since 1896. There will be
exceptions for the very few professionals, such as
vets, who need handguns outside gun clubs for the
humane destruction of animals.
The proposals will mean that at least 160,000
handguns-80 per cent. of those legally held at.
present will be destroyed. Appropriate
compensation will be paid.
In setting out the Labour Party\'s response to these proposals Jack Straw said that:17
As we heard from the Secretary of State for
Scotland, Thomas Hamilton -one man-killed 16
children and one teacher, and injured 17 others, by
discharging 105 rounds of ammunition from a
single semi-automatic handgun in the space of three
minutes. Handguns are small, portable, easy to
hide and lethal. In the light of Lord Cullen\'s
report-and especially his analysis-it is our
considered judgment that handguns should be
banned altogether from general civilian use.
May I make it clear to the Secretary of State
that we shall of course co-operate fully to ensure
that legislation is passed speedily through
Parliament, to implement the will of this House and
the other place for a root-and-branch reform of gun
law? We welcome almost everything in the
Secretary of State\'s statement, and especially the
complete ban on all handguns from people\'s homes.
But, with respect, we do not believe that his
proposals go far enough. Let me briefly give our
reasons.
In the evidence submitted to the Cullen inquiry
on behalf of the Labour party by my hon. Friend
the Member for Hamilton and me, we said that
                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 HC Deb Vol 282 c834-835 16.10.1996
22


Research Paper 96/102
there was a strong case for banning all handguns,
apart from some very limited occupational
exceptions such as vets and casualty slaughterers.
We then said that it was for the shooting fraternity
to make a case for exceptions to that-for example,
in respect of single-shot .22 pistols. But, in our
judgment, the shooting fraternity has failed to do
so.
Lord Cullen says that an exemption for single-
shot .22 handguns would be both impractical and
ineffective because they could easily be reconverted
to multi-shot guns, and we accept that view. Partial
bans, moreover, would create extra work for the
police. As the Police Federation said in its
evidence to Lord Cullen, .22 weapons may be just
as lethal as higher-calibre weapons.
In reply to this the Home Secretary made the following comments about proposals for a
complete prohibition on the ownership and possession of handguns:18
Mr. Howard: I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for the remarks with which he began his
observations. He identified with some precision the
difference that lies between us. We believe that it
is possible to give the public the protection that
they rightly require and deserve without going so
far as to put in place a complete prohibition on the
ownership and possession of handguns for which
the hon. Gentleman called. We believe that if it is
possible to provide that protection without a
complete ban, it is the Government\'s duty to take
that course.
I ask the hon. Gentleman and those sitting
behind him to reflect on the unhappy history of the
complete prohibition of activities hitherto regarded
as lawful. It would not be in anyone\'s interests,
least of all the protection of the public, to drive
underground an activity that could then be
conducted without any safeguards for security,
whereas if it remains possible to carry out that
activity legitimately, under extremely secure
safeguards, the public\'s protection might be greater.
I ask him to reflect on that.
Speaking for the Liberal Democrats Alan Beith said:19
Mr. A. J. Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed): Does
the Home Secretary accept the following
proposition, the importance of which was
underlined by the slaughter at Dunblane? In this
country, we regard the possession of guns not as a
right, but as a privilege that has to be carefully
controlled and safeguarded to protect public safety
and public confidence. As the Government\'s
proposals have much common ground with our
proposals to the Cullen inquiry, will the Home
Secretary note that we are prepared to support and
facilitate legislation based on those proposals, as
long as the House has an opportunity to consider
on a free vote whether a ban on 80 per cent. of
handguns is adequate and workable or whether it is
necessary to go further?

Research Paper 96/102
Under the Government\'s proposals, who would be
allowed to transport guns between one gun club
and another or from a gun club to a competition?
Does the Home Secretary agree that it would be
wrong to pretend that either the proposals or a total
ban provided any guarantee against the misuse of
guns leading to a slaughter such as that at
Dunblane, so vigilance and effective and well-
resourced policing remain essential?
The Home Secretary replied that:20
Mr. Howard: I agree with the right hon.
Gentleman\'s first proposition, that there is no right
to hold a gun under our laws and that it is a
privilege. I agree with that approach and I note
what he said about his party\'s approach to the
legislation.
On the transportation of guns from one club to
another under the proposed arrangements, we intend
to have consultations with chief constables and
others about the details but, as I said in my
statement, we envisage that it should be permitted
only in the most limited circumstances and under
the most stringent controls. For example, the
transportation should be effected not by the owner
of the gun, but by a third party specifically
authorised for that purpose.
I entirely agree with what the right hon.
Gentleman said about illegally held weapons and
about the need for continued vigilance to deal with
that very considerable problem.
Some commentators have criticised the Government for not proposing a complete prohibition
on handguns, citing the view of the Police Federation, in its evidence to Lord Cullen, that .22
calibre firearms may be as lethal as higher-calibre weapons. Press reports claimed that
weapons of this calibre had been used in the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Yitzhak
Rabin, and in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr. Some
commentators have also called for a general prohibition on shotguns, noting, as Lord Cullen
did,21 that an individual shot from a handgun, depending on the distance and calibre, may be
less lethal than a shot from a shotgun or rifle. In its report on The Possession of Handguns
the Home Affairs Committee noted that:22
6. The Home Office, in evidence to Lord Cullen\'s inquiry which was prepared jointly with
the Scottish Office, and which was also submitted to this inquiry, maintained that handguns,
being small, easily concealed and carried, and capable of rapidly firing a large number of
rounds without reloading, were weapons of a "particularly dangerous nature". This view is
not universally held;\' it may be argued that a shot from a standard rifle will generate more

energy than will a shot from a typical self-loading handgun; a shotgun is likely to have a
greater destructive capacity even at close range, due to the spread of the shot.
Lord Cullen also referred in his report to the dangers posed by the use of air weapons at large
and whether they should be subject to certification and unavailable until a later age than at
present. During the debate which followed the Home Secretary\'s statement on the Cullen
report the Home Secretary made the following remarks in reply to questions from Chris
Mullin about the dangers posed by shotguns and air weapons:23
Mr. Chris Mullin (Sunderland, South): I thank
the Home Secretary for endorsing the main plank
of the minority report from the Home Affairs
Committee on the issue. It is not every day that a
minority report is endorsed so swiftly by the Home
Office. I have one or two others that he might like
to reconsider.
Did the Home Secretary hear the comments this
morning by Mr. Michael Yardley, a firearms expert,
that it was pointless to ban handguns if something
was not also done about shotguns? Is it not about
time that we made a start on collecting some of the
2 million shotguns in circulation, starting in urban
areas? Everyone acknowledges that farmers need
shotguns, for reasons that we all know about, but it
is hard to understand why licences should be
granted to shotgun owners in urban areas.
Does the Home Secretary have any plans to do
anything about the misuse of air weapons, which,
as many of our colleagues will know, are
responsible for a great deal of mayhem in urban
areas?
Mr. Howard: I note the hon. Gentleman\'s
opening remarks. I am sure that he does not expect
me to give any undertaking on my reaction to
minority reports from the Home Affairs Committee
in future. I do not follow the hon. Gentleman in
his observations about shotguns. Shotguns have
many wider applications than do handguns, which
are restricted to target shooting. I do not think that
the hon. Gentleman has made a case for the
restriction on shotguns to which he has referred.
Similar observations apply to air rifles.
The Home Affairs Committee\'s report on The Possession of Handguns,24 the report of Lord
Cullen\'s Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane25and the evidence submitted to Lord Cullen\'s
Inquiry on behalf of the Secretary for Scotland and the Home Secretary all contain views on
the possible effects of total or partial prohibitions of various types of guns or of all guns.
Conservative members of the Home Affairs Committee voted against recommendations that
the possession of handguns be banned and a number of other proposals concerning shotguns
and airguns. The Committee\'s report, which caused much controversy, went on reach the
following conclusions on the subject of banning various categories of firearm:26
Banning the possession of all guns
5. We conclude that a ban on the possession of all guns would be too far-reaching.
(para 50)
6. We believe that a ban upon all guns would not prevent unstable individuals from
gaining access to guns illegally, and we therefore reject this option. (para 51)

Partial bans on the possession of handguns

calibre, or on the possession of multi-shot handguns, would make a mass killing
any less likely. We therefore reject these options. (para 63)
10. Although we see some value in the proposal that handguns should be centrally
stored, we do not believe that a determined criminal would be prevented from
using a weapon for criminal purposes; we therefore reject this suggestion. (para 69)
11. We do not favour the proposal for possession of assembled handguns to be banned
other than at licensed premises. (para 70)
12. Although we see [a ban on possession of a handgun with ammunition] as a
potentially attractive solution, we have concluded that there are significant
practical difficulties which cannot be easily overcome, and we therefore reject it.

13. We reject the proposal for restrictions to be placed upon the number of handguns
that an individual might hold. (para 73)
In its report the Home Affairs Committee said it believed that the problems posed by illegally
held firearms were on a far larger scale than those posed by legally held firearms.27 It also
noted that policy on firearms control appeared to be formed without the benefit of statistical
material on the proportion of crime committed with stolen or borrowed legally-held weapons
and recommended that records be kept of the sources of firearms recovered after crime.28 Lord
Cullen noted that while the statistical evidence available to him and to which he had referred
was of limited value it did show that while illegal firearms were used in the great majority
of firearm-related crimes, and especially robberies, the existence of legally held firearms led
to their use in crime in a significant, though relatively small number of cases. (Chapter 9 of
Lord Cullen\'s report and paragraphs 33-36 of the Home Affairs Committee\'s report discuss
the evidence and arguments on this subject in some detail.) In his statement on the changes
proposed by the Government in response to Lord Cullen\'s report the Home Secretary
observed that:29 
Among all the words that have been written since that dreadful event at
Dunblane, there is one irrefutable fact, The crimes that were committed on
13 March were committed with a gun that was legally bought and legally
possessed. Those facts place an extremely onerous duty on the Government
to consider what controls there should be on the ownership and possession
of guns.

3. New Restrictions on Firearms - Part I of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill
 
Clause 1 of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill is intended to prohibit all handguns other than
small-calibre pistols and signalling apparatus by adding the following firearms to the list of
prohibited weapons set out in Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968:
"(aba) any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30 centimetres in
length or is less than 60 centimetres in length overall, other than an air
weapon to which section I of this Act does not apply, a small-calibre
pistol or a firearm designed as signalling apparatus;".
The possession, purchase, acquisition, manufacture, sale or transfer of these weapons without
the authority of the Secretary of State will be an offence punishable on summary conviction
by up to six months\' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine and on indictment by up to ten years\'
imprisonment30 and a fine.
Clauses 2,3,4 and 5 of the Bill are intended to provide exemptions from the need for
authorisation from the Secretary of State in respect of a handgun prohibited by virtue of
Clause 1 in four sets of circumstances. These are:
i) Slaughtering Instruments, where the person possessing, purchasing, acquiring, selling
or transferring the instrument is authorised by a firearm certificate to have in his possession,
purchase or acquire such an instrument, or where he has it in his possession and is entitled
to do so without a firearm certificate under Section 10 of the Firearms Act 1968. (Section 10
of the 1968 Act permits licensed animal slaughterers and others to have slaughtering
instruments in their possession in certain circumstances - see p.12 above)
ii) Firearms used for the humane killing of animals, where the person is authorised under
a firearm certificate to have in his possession, purchase, acquire, sell or transfer a firearm
subject to a condition that it is only for use in connection with the humane killing of animals;
iii) Firearms used in connection with starting races at athletic meetings, where a person is
authorised under a firearm certificate to have in his possession, purchase or acquire a firearm
subject to a condition that it is only for use in connection with starting races at athletic
meetings, or where the person has it in his possession for that purpose at an athletic meeting.
iv) Trophies of war, where a person has in his possession a firearm which is a trophy of
war acquired by him before 1 January 1946 and has a firearm certificate authorising him to
do so.

Section 19 of the Firearms Act 1968 Act makes it an offence for a person to have a loaded
shotgun or air weapon, or any other loaded or unloaded firearm, together with ammunition
suitable for use in that firearm, with him in a public place, without lawful authority or
reasonable excuse (the proof of which lies on him, rather than the prosecution). Halsbury\'s
Statutes notes that "with him in a public place" is thought to mean "knowingly has with him
in any public place"31
Clause 6 will insert a new Section 19A in the Firearms Act 1968, designed to make it an
offence for "any person to have a small-calibre pistol [that is, a pistol chambered for .22 or
smaller rim-fire cartridges]32 with him outside licensed premises of a licensed pistol club".
On the basis of the case-law referred to in Halsbury\'s Statutes it would seem likely that "with
him" here will be taken to mean "knowingly with him" The offence will be punishable on
summary conviction by up to six months\' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine, and on conviction
on indictment by up to ten years\' imprisonment and a fine. It will not be an offence for a
person to have such a weapon with him if he is permitted under the Act to have the pistol
in his possession without holding a firearm certificate, if he is authorised to have the pistol
in his possession under a firearm certificate which is not subject to a condition requiring it
to be kept at a licensed pistol club, or if he is authorised to do so by virtue of a police permit
under Clause 8 of the Bill.
Clause 7 of the Bill is intended to ensure that, where a person applies for a firearm certificate
for a small-calibre pistol and the chief officer of police is satisfied that the applicant\'s only
reason for having the pistol in his possession is to use it for target shooting, any certificate
granted to the applicant should be held subject to at least the following conditions:
a) the pistol is only to be used for target shooting;
b) the holder must be a member of a licensed pistol club specified in the certificate;
c) the pistol must be kept and used only at specified licensed premises of that club.
An existing firearm certificate relating to a small-calibre pistol, which is subject to the
condition that the pistol is only to be used on an approved range, will, after the
implementation of the provisions in the Bill, be treated as being held subject to the new
conditions set out in Clause 7.

Research Paper 96/102
A person who fails to comply with these conditions and thereby commits an offence under
Section 1(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 is to be treated, for the purposes of sentencing, as
having committed that offence in an aggravated form. At present this offence is a summary
offence punishable by up to six months\' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine. Under amendments
set out in paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Bill the aggravated form will also be punishable
following conviction on indictment by up to seven years\' imprisonment and a fine. 
Clause 8 is intended to enable chief officers of police to issue permits authorising small-
calibre pistols to be taken outside licensed club premises for any "proper purpose" Clause 8(3)
goes on to say that:
(3) A proper purpose for having a small-calibre pistol outside the licensed
premises of a licensed pistol club may be any of the following, namely-
(a) having the pistol repaired or maintained by a registered firearms
dealer;
(b) conveying the pistol from a police station at which it has been
kept to a licensed pistol club or from one such club to another;
(c) enabling the pistol to be used at a recognised target shooting
competition;
(d) selling or otherwise disposing of the pistol; or
(e) any other purpose which appears to the chief officer of police to
be proper in all the circumstances.
Chief officers will be able to attach conditions to these permits in the interest of safety. It will
be an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months\' imprisonment and a
£5,000 fine for a person to fail to comply with such a condition or "knowingly or recklessly"
to make a false statement for the purpose of procuring a permit for himself or another under
this provision.
Clause 9 and Schedule 1 of the Bill set out transitional arrangements intended to enable
holders of small-calibre pistols to hand them to the police until such time as they can become
members of licensed pistol clubs. They will be required to become members of such clubs
within a transitional period of a year from the implementation of the relevant provisions of
the Bill, or a longer period, if this is specified in an order made by the Secretary of State
using the negative procedure. Small-calibre pistols handed in under these provisions will be
retrievable provided that the police are given written notice at least four weeks before the end
of the transitional period. If they are not retrieved within the transitional period they will be
treated as having been surrendered to the police. It will be an offence punishable on summary
conviction by up to six months\' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine for a person knowingly or
recklessly to make a false statement for the purpose of procuring the release of a pistol from
police custody, whether it is for himself or for another person.

C. Firearm and Shotgun Certification Procedures
1. Current Arrangements
The procedure governing the grant, renewal, variation and revocation of firearm and shotgun
certificates is set out in Sections 26-32 of the Firearms Act 1968. A Home Office publication
Firearms Law: Guidance to the Police, which was published in 1989, explains the provisions
of the 1968 Act as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and others and gives
guidance to the police on how they should exercise their discretion in respect of the grant,
variation and revocation of firearm and shotgun certificates and other matters.
The current certification procedures are summarised in the evidence submitted on behalf of
the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to Lord Cullen\'s Inquiry as
follows:33
27. The two main levels of control are the shot gun certificate and firearm certificate
(sections 1 and 2 of the 19 68 Act) . Like a firearm certificate, a shot gun certificate is issued
by the chief officer of police. But the licensing regime it imposes is different from, and less
stringent than, that imposed by the firearm certificate.
28. Firearm and shot gun certificates both bear four standard, statutory conditions - These
require the holder to sign the certificate, to inform the police of thefts and losses and of any
change of address, and to keep the weapons and ammunition securely. There are three major
additional restrictions in the licensing regime imposed by the firearm, as compared with the
shot gun, certificate. These are
a to obtain a firearm certificate, the applicant has to show the police that he has a good
reason for possessing all the firearms and ammunition which it covers;
b  every firearm and piece of ammunition covered by a firearm certificate must be
approved by the police in advance; and
c the police may place additional  conditions upon firearm certificates, such as, for
example, that the firearm is to be used only at a particular shooting range.
29. The first two of these differences derive from the fact that the applicant for a firearm
certificate has to demonstrate that he has a good reason for possessing \'the firearm or
ammunition in respect of which (the application) is made,\' (section 27(1) of the 1968 Act).
But the applicant for a shot gun certificate does not (though the police cannot - section 28
(1A) (b) of the 1968 Act - grant a shot gun certificate if they are satisfied that the applicant
does not have a good reason for possessing a shot gun).
                                                                                                                                                                                            
33 Dep p7-8
31


Research Paper 96/102
30. Similarly, the holder of a shot gun certificate does not have to seek police permission
before obtaining a new shot gun. He must however keep his shot gun certificate up to date
to list all the guns which it covers (section 28(2A) of the 1968 Act), and both he and the
dealer, or other person, who sells him a gun is required to notify the police of the sale (see
the notes on the rear of the shot gun certificate in the Firearms Rules (Scotland) 1989 and
section 4 of the 1988 Act).
31. The police may add further conditions to a firearm certificate under the terms of
section 27 (2) of the 1968 Act. The Act places no limitations on the conditions which the
police may impose on a firearm certificate. These vary widely to suit the circumstances, and
there is extensive Home Office advice about them in Chapter 6 of the published Home Office
Guidance to the Police (see Annex C).
32. However the police may not, in general, add further conditions to a shot gun certificate.
The only (minor) exception to that is when the certificate authorises the holder to possess a
shot gun disguised as another object (for example a walking stick gun) as part of a collection.
33. The police are then required to add a fifth condition to the shot gun certificate. The
wording of this is specified by law (Rule 4A of the Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1989, as
inserted by Rule 4 of the Firearms (Scotland) (Amendment) Rules 1992 - it reads a shot gun
which is disguised as another object is possessed, purchased or acquired by the holder of the
certificate only for the purpose of its being kept or exhibited as part of a collection I) . There
are no circumstances in which the law allows chief officers to formulate additional conditions
for a shot gun certificate, as they can with a firearm certificate.
34. Firearm and shot gun certificates must be renewed at regular intervals. There is scope
for firearm certificates to be varied, and there is provision for applicants who disagree with
police decisions in respect of them to appeal against these decisions in the Courts.
 
Firearm Certificates
Sections 27(1) and 27(1A) of the Firearms Act 1968 provide that:
(1) A firearm certificate shall be granted by the chief officer of police
if he is satisfied that the applicant has a good reason tor having in his
possession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or ammunition in
respect of which the application is made, and can be permitted to have it in
his possession without danger to the public safety or to the peace:
Provided that a firearm certificate shall not be granted to a person whom
the chief officer of police has reason to believe to be prohibited by this Act
from possessing a firearm to which section 1 of this Act applies, or to be of
intemperate habits or unsound mind, or to be for any reason unfitted to be
entrusted with such a firearm.
[(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1) above a person under the age
of eighteen shall be capable of having good reason for having a firearm or
ammunition in his possession, or for purchasing or acquiring it, only if he
has no intention of using the firearm or ammunition, at any time before he
attains the age of eighteen, for a purpose not authorised by the European
32


Research Paper 96/102
weapons directive.]
In commenting on the grant or refusal of firearm certificates the Home Office guidance notes
that :34
6.6 The most important duty imposed by the Act on the police is that of deciding whether
or not a firearm certificate should be granted. The criteria which chief officers of police
should apply in exercising their discretion are set out in section 27(1). A chief officer of
police must not grant a certificate to any person whom he has reason to believe to be:
(a) prohibited by the Act from possessing a firearm, eg a person to whom section 21
applies; or
(b) of intemperate habits or unsound mind; or
(c) to be for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm.
6.7 If the grant of the certificate is not so precluded, the chief officer of police has to
satisfy himself on two points: that the applicant
(a) has a good reason for requiring the firearm or ammunition in respect of which the
application is made; and
(b) can be permitted to have the firearm or ammunition without danger to public safety
or to the peace.
Forces will normally be expected to give reasons for their decision to refuse an application for
a firearm certificate.
The guidance sets out a number of points for police officers to bear in mind when considering
applications for firearm certificates. These include the following 35
(a) The reason given for desiring a firearm must be one applicable to the particular class
of firearm which the person desires to possess. It should be recognised that some
classes of firearm do have more than one legitimate use.
(b) The terms of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 make it an offence to kill certain
types of wildlife, and also restrict the type of firearm that can be used in those limited
circumstances where killing is permitted. Advice on this Act can be obtained from the
Department of the Environment, Wildlife Division, Tollgate House, Houlton Street,
Bristol BS2 9DJ for use in England and Wales, and from the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland, Chesser House, Gorgie Road, Edinburgh, for use in
Scotland.
(c) Similarly, the Deer Act 1963 as amended by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (in
Scotland the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959 and the Deer (Close Seasons) (Scotland) order

Research Paper 96/102
1984) prohibit the taking of deer at certain times and make it an offence to use certain
devices, including some types of firearm and calibres, against then. Schedule 2 to the
Deer Act 1963 prohibits the use of rifles with a calibre of less than .240 inches or a
muzzle energy of less than 1,700 foot pounds. In respect of England and Wales, advice
on the 1963 Act can be obtained from E Division, Home Office, 50 Queen Anne\'s Gate,
London SW1H 9AT. In respect of Scotland, advice on the deer legislation can be
obtained from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, Pentland
House, 47 Robbs Loan, Edinburgh, EH14 1TW or the Red Deer Commission,
Knowsley, 82 Pairfield Road, Inverness, IV3 SLH.
(d) It should also be established that the land areas over which an applicant intends to shoot
are suitable from a safety point of view for the class of weapon which it is proposed
to use (see paragraph 6.22).
(e) A certificate for a handgun with ammunition should not be granted (except in very rare
cases) unless the applicant has regular and legitimate opportunity of using the weapon
eg for target practice as a member of a pistol shooting club. Certificates should not,
however, be issued for "fast draw" competitions for which adequate non-convertible
imitation firearms are readily available.
(f) An applicant wishing to obtain a certificate for a smooth-bore gun with a magazine
capable of holding more than two cartridges must demonstrate a reason applicable to
a larger capacity smooth-bore gun. There are relatively few instances in which a
limited capacity smooth-bore gun will not serve as well. Claypigeon shooting, for
example, does not require a participant to discharge more than two shots before
reloading and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the use of the larger
capacity weapon to take wildlife other than under certain conditions (see subparagraph
b above). However, an application to use such a gun, for example, for controlling
wood pigeons and similar pests on a farm or for practical target shooting by a member
of a relevant organisation, should normally represent a good reason for the grant of a
certificate.
(g) If the applicant wishes to obtain a certificate for the purpose of collecting firearms
and/or ammunition, the factors set out in paragraphs 6.13 and 6.14 should be considered
carefully.
(h) Applications for the grant of a firearm certificate for the applicant\'s protection or that
of his premises should be refused on the grounds that firearms are not regarded as an
acceptable means of protection in this country. This principle should be maintained
even in the case of applications from representatives of banks and firms who desire to
protect valuables or large quantities of money.
(i) Each application should be considered on its merits in respect of the total number of
firearms to be held on the certificate, the number of firearms of particular calibres
applied for and the applicant\'s security arrangements. The "good reason" requirement
will need to be satisfactorily demonstrated in respect of each firearm. Thorough
enquiries must be undertaken regardless of whether this involves making enquiries
outside the applicant\'s police area. It is also desirable to have written confirmation of
an applicant\'s club membership status or permission to shoot over land. No arbitrary
limit should be applied to the number of firearms which may be held. Where firearms
of a similar calibre are to be used for different purposes, the applicant will need to
satisfy the police as to the purpose for which each is required. It should be recognised
34


Research Paper 96/102
that target shooters may require several firearms for various disciplines and that persons
shooting for sporting purposes may require different weapons for variations in game
and terrain.
(j) It is not possible to give firm guidance on the amount of ammunition which may be
authorised by a certificate. Each case should be dealt with on its merits. While account
should be taken of the fact that it is normal practice to purchase ammunition by batches
for consistency of performance and that reloading or buying ammunition in bulk is
cheaper, chief officers will wish to pay regard to the risks attendant upon unnecessarily
large quantities of ammunition being held on private premises. Where larger quantities
are authorised, particular attention must also be given to the security arrangements.
The evidence submitted by the Home Office to the Home Affairs Committee for its inquiry
into the Possession of Handguns makes the following observations about current arrangements
for assessing an applicant\'s personal suitability and the requirement that the application be
countersigned by a person known to the applicant:36 
Personal suitability
65. In cases where the prohibition under section 21 does not apply, the chief officer
must decide on the circumstances of the case whether an applicant with a criminal record
should be granted a certificate. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply to
applications for firearm certificates and a person applying for a certificate must declare any
conviction by a Court at home or abroad, however old or minor.
66 The police are sometimes required to make delicate decisions about issuing firearm
certificates to people who have criminal records or to people who are thought to have, or to
have had, criminal associates but have no conviction. More difficult than these can be cases
in which the individual is thought to be suffering from mental disorder of some kind,
especially ones in which there is no formal indication of it (for instance, no admissions to a
mental hospital or other medical evidence).
67. The Government does not give the police central guidance about circumstances of
that kind. It is up to chief officers to exercise their statutory discretion. An applicant who
is dissatisfied with the police decision can take the matter to appeal, or seek judicial review
of it.
Countersigning certificate applications
68. The Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1989 require each application for a firearm certificate
to be countersigned by a person who is resident in Great Britain, is not a relative of.the
applicant, and has known them personally for at least two years. The countersignatory must
also be a Member of Parliament, Justice of the Peace, minister of religion, doctor, lawyer,
established civil servant, bank officer or "person of similar standing".
69. These categories of person are the same as those who can countersign applications
for passports. In practice, we understand that police forces have over the last few years, and
following a recommendation of the Firearms Consultative Committee, interpreted the phrase
                                                                                                                                                                                            
36 HC 393-II Session 1995-96 p42
35


Research Paper 96/102
"person of similar standing" fairly widely so that countersignatures are accepted from a wide
variety of people so long as they are of good character and otherwise qualified under the
Rules.
70. The countersignatory has to confirm that the information which the applicant has
provided is, so far as they know, true and to vouch for the passport-size photographs which
they provide. The 1989 Rules brought in a further requirement that they should confirm that
they "know of no reason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess a firarm".
Notes on the back of the form tell them that they should "bear in mind the character, conduct
and mental condition of the applicant in so far as they are relevant. . . "
71. The countersignatory may be the applicant\'s doctor, and in many cases the doctor
does countersign. But a doctor\'s signature is not required by law.
Shotgun Certificates
As the evidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to
the Cullen Inquiry noted,37 the rules which govern the grant or renewal of shotgun certificates
are slightly less exacting than those concerning firearm certificates.
Sections 28(1), 28(1A), 28(1B) and 28(1C) of the Firearms Act 1968 provide that:
(1)Subject to subsection (1A) below, a shot gun certificate shall be
granted or, as the case may be, renewed by the chief officer of police if he
is satisfied that the applicant can be permitted to possess a shot gun without
danger to the public safety or to the peace.
(1A) No such certificate shall be granted or renewed if the chief officer
of police-
(a) has reason to believe that the applicant is prohibited by this Act
from possessing a shot gun; or
(h) is satisfied that the applicant does not have a good reason for
possessing, purchasing or acquiring one.
(1B) For the purposes of paragraph (h) of subsection (1 A) above an
applicant shall, in particular, be regarded as having a good reason if the gun
is intended to be used for sporting or competition purposes or for shooting
vermin; and an application shall not be refused by virtue of that paragraph
merely because the applicant intends neither to use the gun himself nor to
lend it for anyone else to use.
(1C) A person under the age of eighteen shall be regarded for the
purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1A) as not having a good reason
for possessing, purchasing or acquiring a shot gun if it is his intention to use
the shot gun, at any time before he attains the age of eighteen, for a purpose
                                                                                                                                                                                            
37 above, p

not authorised by the European weapons directive.
The Home Office guidance notes that:38
7.6 The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 revised the criteria set out in section 28 of the
1968 Act for the grant or renewal of a shot gun certificate so as to allow chief officers of
police more discretion to make enquiries into applications. It is important to note how the
criteria differ from those in respect of Applications under section 1 of the Act. No certificate
shall be granted or renewed if the chief officer of police:
(a) has reason to believe that the applicant is prohibited by the Act from possessing a
shot gun; or
(b) is satisfied that the applicant does not have a good reason for possessing, purchasing
or acquiring one.
Section 28(1B) of the Act, as amended, provides for sporting and competition purposes or the
shooting of vermin to be regarded as good reasons for possessing a shot gun and that an
application may not be refused merely because an applicant wants to possess but not use a
shot gun. This is likely to be the case where the shot gun is of special significance to.the
applicant, such as an heirloom or of some other sentimental value. However, the Act does
NOT require the applicant to make out a good case for being granted a certificate but rather
extends the chief officer\'s ground for refusing one. A chief officer should therefore need to
make further enquiries only where it comes to his notice that there may be genuine doubts
about an applicant\'s reasons for possessing a shot gun.
7.7 If the grant of a certificate is not so precluded, the chief officer of police has to satisfy
himself that the applicant can be permitted to possess a shot gun without danger to the public
safety or the peace. This may necessitate an interview and consideration of his security
arrangements. Where a visit to the applicant\'s home is considered necessary, this should,
where possible, be made by prior appointment. Applicants usually provide a telephone
number where they can be contacted for this purpose. This information is requested on form
103.
7.8 The words "danger to the public safety or to the peace" also appear in section 27(1)
dealing with the grant of a firearm certificate. A conviction for a criminal offence which does
not result in a sentence to which section 21 applies should not be an automatic bar to the issue
of a shot gun certificate but convictions for some offences might cast doubt on the ability of
an applicant to have shot guns without endangering the public safety. Any relevant
information known to the police about the applicant such as mental illness or intemperate
habits may be taken into account, but it should be borne in mind that supporting evidence may
have to be produced in court if a refused applicant appeals to the Crown Court (in England
and Wales) or the Sheriff (in Scotland). Forces will normally be expected to give reasons for
refusing an application for a shot gun certificate.
Under Section 28(2A) of the 1968 Act, a shotgun certificate must specify the description of
                                                                                                                                                                                            
38 Firearms law: Guidance to the Police - Home Office (1989) p87-89

Research Paper 96/102
the shotguns to which it relates including, if known, the identification numbers of the guns.
A shotgun certificate may, therefore relate to more than one weapon, whereas a firearm
certificate authorises the possession of the one particular weapon specified on the certificate
and ammunition for that weapon.
Variation of Firearm Certificates
Section 29 of the Firearms Act 1968 enables a chief officer of police for the area in which
the holder of a firearm certificate resides to vary, by notice in writing, the conditions under
which the certificate is held. The certificate holder may also apply to the chief officer of
police for a variation of these conditions and may appeal to the Courts (the Crown Court in
England and Wales and the sheriff court in Scotland) against the chief officer\'s refusal to vary
them.
Revocation of Firearm and Shotgun Certificates
Section 30 of the Firearms Act 1968 permits the revocation of firearm and shotgun
certificates in the following circumstances:
30 Revocation of certificates
(1) A firearm certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of police
for the area in which the holder resides if-
(a) the chief officer is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act
from possessing a firearm to which section 1 of this Act applies or is
of intemperate habits or unsound mind, or is otherwise unfitted to be
entrusted with such a firearm; or
(b) the holder fails to comply with a notice under section 29(1) of this
Act requiring him to deliver up the certificate.
(2) A shot gun certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of
police if he is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act from
possessing a shot gun or cannot be permitted to possess a shot gun without
danger to the public safety or to the peace.
A person aggrieved by the revocation of a certificate may appeal to the Courts against the
decision.
The circumstances in which firearm and shotgun certificates may be revoked are not exactly
the same as those in which an application for the initial grant or renewal of a certificate may
be rejected. In particular, there is no clear power for the police to revoke a certificate on the
grounds that the "good reason" for which it was initially granted no longer applies. The
evidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to the
38


Research Paper 96/102
Cullen Inquiry noted this and observed that:39
Unless a certificate holder sustains a criminal conviction during the currency
of his certificate, the conditions for revocation may not apply in practice.
There are not, compared to the overall number of certificates, a large
number of revocations.
Security.
The police have no explicit statutory right to inspect applicants\' proposed storage
arrangements. They do, however, have a general discretion to grant, renew or revoke
certificates, under the provisions of the 1968 Act set out in earlier in this Chapter. In its fifth
annual report the Firearms Consultative Committee, which was set up under the Firearms
(Amendment) Act 1988 to keep the provisions of the Firearms Acts under review and make
recommendations for procedural improvements and legislative amendments, rejected a
suggestion that the police be given a specific statutory right to carry out security inspections
on applicants\' premises. The Committee considered that there should be no explicit power,
but that it was reasonable for the police to inspect an applicants\' security40 
The evidence submitted by the Home Office to the Home Affairs Committee for its inquiry
into the Possession of Handguns made the following observations about the security of
firearms, in the context of police officers\' assessments of whether or not an applicant for a
firearm certificate could be permitted to have a firearm in his possession without danger to
the public safety or to the police:41
 58. There are two main considerations which the police must have in mind when
considering whether an applicant might, if granted a firearm certificate, be a danger to public
safety or to the peace. The first has to do with the security with which the applicant will keep
any guns or ammunition he is allowed to possess.
59. Standard condition 4 of the firearm certificate places holders under a duty to take
all "reasonable\' security precautions, both when the firearm and ammunition are in store at
home or elsewhere and when they are in use or in transit. The Home Office has issued a
pamphlet which gives guidance to the police and public on what this means in practice.
60. There is no bar on holders of firearm certificates keeping their firearms and
ammunition at home, provided that their certificates do not bear a condition which prevents
them from doing that. In practice, the vast majority of certificate holders do keep their
firearms and ammunition at home, in secure conditions which satisfy the police that they am
meeting their legal duty to take all reasonable precautions for their security.

61. The police will generally visit people who are applying for their first firearm
certificate, both in order to assess their security arrangements at first hand and to interview
them generally about their reasons for wanting to have a firearm and their general background.
This allows an assessment of the individual\'s personal suitability, which is the second issue
relating to public safety.
2. Lord Cullen\'s Recommendations
Lord Cullen\'s observations and recommendations on the certification system relating to
firearms as defined by Section 1 of the Firearms Act 1968 are set out in detail in Chapter 8
of his report. He made the following remarks about arrangements for assessing the suitability
of applicants for firearm certificates:42
8.56 I use the term "suitability" as a convenient expression to cover the provision in section
27(1) that a firearm certificate is to be granted by the chief officer of police if he is satisfied
that the applicant "can be permitted to have it (the relevant firearm or ammunition) in his
possession without danger to the public safety or to the peace" (in so far as this turns on the
personal suitability of the applicant); and the provision that the certificate is not to be granted
to a person whom the chief officer of police "has reason to believe .... to be of intemperate
habits or unsound mind, or to be for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with such a firearm".
Section 30(1) enables the chief officer to revoke if he is "satisfied that the holder ... is of
intemperate habits or unsound mind. or is otherwise unfitted to be entrusted with such a
firearm".
8.57 This language is substantially the same as that contained in the Firearms Act 1920,
which was the first legislation for regulating the possession of firearms. Although the
language is of long-standing it contains a number of difficulties which were discussed at the
Inquiry. These may be summarised as follows.
8.58 The intention behind the proviso to section 27(1) seems to have been to prohibit the
granting of a certificate in certain definite situations; whereas under the leading provision of
that sub-section the chief officer of police was to have some discretion in deciding whether
the applicant could be permitted to have the relevant firearm or ammunition in his possession.
If he was so satisfied he was bound to grant the certificate.
8.59 However, the matter is not as simple as that. It is not difficult to understand why
"unsound mind" should appear in the proviso. Even if it is wider than insanity and
encompasses any degree of mental instability, it will be normal for it to be presumed that a
person is of sound mind until the contrary appears. It is also a matter which can be
reasonably closely defined. The same perhaps may be said of "intemperate habits" which
appears to embrace not merely lack of temperance in regard to alcohol or drugs but also
immoderate conduct whatever be the cause (see P J Clarke and J W Ellis, The Law relating
to Firearms (1981) at pages 96-97). Thus far the terms of the proviso appear to deal with
cases which are irrespective of whether there is danger to the public safety or to the peace in
the applicant being permitted to have possession of the firearm or ammunition in question.
However, there is already an overlap between cases which fall foul of the proviso and those
which do not meet the leading provision. When one comes to the expression "unfitted to be
entrusted with such a firearm" it is clear that there is a substantial overlap, and it is in regard
                                                                                                                                                                                            
42 ibid p94-95
40


Research Paper 96/102
to a matter which appears to be primarily a question of judgment. It suggests that the
arrangement of concepts with which the sub-section deals is not of the happiest.
41


Research Paper 96/102
8.60 The meaning of "unfitted"...... has been little discussed in decisions and text books. It
is clearly a neglected corner in firearms legislation. When one looks at the Guidance to the
Police one finds that after para 6.6 which recites the terms of the proviso the text concentrates
on the question of danger to public safety and to the peace (6.9). This seems to overlook the
point that the phrase "unfitted"...... is of wide import.
8.61 When one turns to section 30(1) one finds not merely that there is no provision for
revocation where the good reason has ceased but also that the power to revoke is limited to
a situation in which the proviso in section 27(1) would have applied; with the two additional
peculiarities, that section 30(1) uses "Is satisfied that" rather than the somewhat weaker
expression "has reason to believe"; and that the word "otherwise" now appears in front of the
word "unfitted". The mismatching between sections 30(1) and section 27(1) is highlighted by
the fact that in the case of shot guns the same test of danger is used both in regard to the
granting of the application (section 28(1)) and in regard to the question of revocation (section
30(2)).
8.62 1 am bound to say that I consider that it is high time that the language of sections 27
and 30 is revised in order to achieve a logical and consistent arrangement.
8.63 However, there is at this point a consideration which is of greater moment in regard to
the protection and safety of the public which lies at the heart of the legislation. The
circumstances of the present case seem to me to demonstrate the need for a positive
requirement that the applicant should be a person who is fit to be entrusted with the relevant
firearm and ammunition, so that where the information on this is not seen as persuasive the
certificate should be withheld. This entails some reorientation of section 27(1) with the result
that the matters as to which the chief officer of police is to be positively satisfied would
include the fitness of the applicant.
8.64 At the same time I am conscious that, without prejudice to what a court may decide are
the limits of "fitness", it would be desirable if some guidance could be given to the police and
to applicants. I am aware that a number of police forces provide leaflets for the guidance of
shooters but, so far as I have been able to discover, there is no national guidance on the
subject. The expression "unfitted", in the context in which it is used, seems to me to be
capable of embracing deficiencies not merely in physical or mental ability but also in a
responsible attitude to such matters as compliance with the legislation, the safe keeping and
handling of firearms and elementary co-operation with the licensing authority.
8.65 As regards section 30(1) 1 consider that it should be brought into full correspondence
with section 27(1) with the result that a certificate may be revoked also when the chief officer
of police is satisfied that the holder cannot be permitted to possess the firearm or ammunition
without danger to the public safety or to the peace.
42


Research Paper 96/102
Lord Cullen\'s view of the current requirement for counter-signatories was as follows:43
8.81 I consider that the current requirement for a counter-signatory should be abolished and
should be replaced by a system for the obtaining of references as one source of information
for the police. The object of such a system would be to provide the police not with negative
but with positive statements about the applicant without imposing on referees the burden of
declaring that the applicant was a fit person to the best of their knowledge and belief. I
consider that there should be two referees, neither of whom should be a member of the
applicant\'s family. They should both be persons of good character. One of them should be
an official of an approved shooting club of which the applicant is a member. The other
should be a person who is not a member of any shooting club. The latter should have known
the applicant personally for at least 2 years. Each of the referees should be expected to supply
a reference to the police in the form of answers to a questionnaire designed to bring out the
extent and nature of their knowledge of the applicant. with particular reference to his character,
conduct and mental condition. It would be open to the police to reject a referee who did not
appear to have adequate knowledge of the applicant. A reference would normally be treated
as confidential but might require to be made available to the applicant in the event of an
appeal.
8.82 I do not support the submission that such referees should be made responsible for
reporting any subsequent material change of circumstances or be subject to prosecution for
failing to do so. It would. in my view, impose such a burden as to be counter-productive.
8.83 If a system of referees were introduced it would be for the police to decide in the
particular case whether and to what extent a reference should be followed up by further
enquiry of the referees.
Lord Cullen also made the following comments about police powers in relation to firearm
certification:44
8.14 It was pointed out in a number of the submissions that the police do not have an
explicit statutory power to insist on inspection of security arrangements prior to the grant or
renewal of a firearm certificate or at any time during the life of the certificate. They also do
not have an explicit power to insist on inspection of the firearms held. I am not persuaded
that it is appropriate to go as far as to grant police a statutory power of entry and inspection
in connection with the initial grant or subsequent renewal. No doubt the police require to be
satisfied in regard to the security arrangements. If the police cannot obtain satisfactory
information about the security arrangements, or for that matter the firearms held, the remedy
should be the refusal of the application. If necessary, legislative provision for this can be
made. As regards the position during the currency of the certificate I do not consider that
there are sufficient grounds to arm the police with a general right to insist on entry and
inspection regardless of whether there is any apprehension of danger to the public.
8.15 The Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales (ACPO) submitted that
police officers should be given the power to enter premises and seize firearms without warrant
on refusal, revocation or suspension of a firearm certificate. The Association of Chief Police
Officers in Scotland (ACOPS) submitted that police officers should be given a power to seize

Research Paper 96/102
certificates, firearms and ammunition prior to any revocation. It may be noted that where a
firearm certificate is revoked under section 30(1 )(a) or (2) of the 1968 Act the chief officer
of police may require the certificate holder by notice in writing to surrender the certificate and
any firearms and ammunition which are in his possession by virtue of it. Failure to comply
is an offence (section 12(1) and (2) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988). This would
justify an application for a warrant to search premises and seize firearms and ammunition
under section 46 of the 1968 Act which applies where there is reasonable grounds for
suspecting that a relevant offence has been, is being or is about to be committed. However,
leaving that particular case to one side, there do not appear to me to be explicit powers
enabling police officers to seize certificates. firearms and ammunition where there is no
question of an offence but where there is reasonable ground for suspecting that there is a
substantial risk to the safety of the public. At present the police have to rely on the co-
operation of the holder. I consider that provision should be made for such a power to be
granted by a justice of the peace or, in Scotland. the sheriff, on the same lines as section 46.
The powers under section 46 should also be extended to any civilian licensing and enquiry
officer who is authorised in writing by the Chief Constable for that purpose.
8.16 1 have also noted that while such civilian officers now have the right to possess
firearms in the course of their duty without the need to hold a firearm certificate covering
them, they do not have the same powers as police officers to inspect dealers\' registers and
premises and approved clubs. I agree with the view that this is an area which needs to be
dealt with in the process of making civilisation effective.
The full list of Lord Cullen\'s recommendations is set out in his report\'s concluding chapter.
Many of his recommendations are concerned with, and can be implemented by changes in the
Home Office guidance to the police rather than by primary legislation. Those
recommendations requiring legislation are as follows:
4. The power of search with warrant under section 46 of the Firearms
Act 1968 should be extended to cases in which there is reasonable
ground for suspecting that there is a substantial risk to the safety of the
public; and to include in such cases the power to seize and detain any
firearm certificate which may he found.
5. The power of search with warrant under section 46 of the Firearms
Act 1968 should be extended to any civilian licensing and enquiry officer
who is authorised in writing for that purpose by the Chief Constable.
6. The powers enjoyed by police officers to inspect dealers\' registers
and premises and approved clubs should he extended to civilian
licensing and enquiry officers who are authorised in writing for that
purpose by the Chief Constable.
9. Section 30(1) of the Firearms Act 1968 should he amended so as to
provide for-
- the revocation of a firearm certificate on the ground that the chief
officer of police is satisfied that the holder does not have a good
reason for having in his possession, or for purchasing or
acquiring, the firearm or ammunition in respect of which the
44


Research Paper 96/102
certificate is held; and for partial revocation; and
- in the case of the revocation of a firearm certificate in respect of
the ammunition to which it relates, the power to substitute
different quantities.
11. Every bolder of a firearm certificate should he required to be a
member of at least one approved club; and the certificate should specify
the approved club or dubs of which he or she is a member and the
which he or she intends to use in each of them.
15. Explicit statutory provision should he made for the laying down
of criteria for the approval of clubs for the purpose of section 15 of the
Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988.
16. The language of section 30(1) of the Firearms Act 1968 should be
brought into full correspondence with that of section 27(1); and each
revised in order to achieve a logical and consistent arrangement.
The Government has accepted all of these recommendations.45 In his statement to the House
of Commons on the day the Cullen report and the Government\'s response were published the
Home Secretary said:46
Lord Cullen has made 23 recommendations for
strengthening the regulatory controls on the
ownership and licensing of all guns. We accept
them all. The Government\'s detailed response has
been placed in the Library. There are seven
recommendations for improving the way in which
the police handle all applications for firearms
certificates, a further eight recommendations deal
with the grounds for obtaining a firearms
certificate, and eight recommendations are about the
suitability of individuals to hold firearms.
I draw particular attention to the following
recommendations: in future, anyone applying for a
firearms certificate should be assessed against a
checklist of criteria for suitability, a clear burden
should be placed on the applicant to show that he
is fit to have a gun, a new power should be created
to enable the police to revoke a certificate where
there is no longer a "good reason" for having a
firearm, and the grounds on which an appeal
against the refusal of a certificate can be made
should be significantly limited. Taken together,
those 23 recommendations add up to a drastic
strengthening of controls on gun ownership.
In addition to Lord Cullen\'s proposals, we intend to
introduce four further measures. First, we shall
make it a requirement for all handgun shooters to
obtain a certificate in order to fire a handgun at a
gun club. Secondly, we shall make it an offence to
fail to notify the police whenever a firearm or
shotgun is sold, transferred, deactivated or
destroyed. Thirdly, we propose to ban the sales of
guns through the post. In future, it will be
unlawful to transfer a gun from one person to
another, except in person.
Fourthly, one of the most shocking and
distressing features of the tragic events in Dunblane
was the use of expanding ammunition, which is
designed to cause the maximum injury. There is no
possible justification at all for it to be available for
people whose only authority is for target shooting.
In future, therefore, it will be illegal to possess
expanding ammunition except for the purposes of

shooting deer, in accordance with the Deer Act
1991.
The current law and practice concerning gun clubs and the Government\'s proposals for the
licensing and regulation of pistol and rifle clubs under Part II and Clauses 35 and 36 of the
Firearms (Amendment) Bill are set out elsewhere in this paper.
3. Regulation of Firearms and Ammunition - Part III of the Bill
Prohibition of Expanding Ammunition
Clause 25 of the Bill is designed to prohibit expanding ammunition by adding a category of
"ammunition which incorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact" to the
list of weapons and ammunition which are subject to general prohibition under Section 5(1A)
of the 1968 Act and can only be possessed, bought acquired, sold or transferred with the
authority of the Secretary of State. Clause 26 will amend Section 5A(4) of the 1968 Act,
providing an exception to the prohibition on expanding ammunition by permitting its
continuing use by people who are authorised by firearm certificates which specify that it is
to be used only for the purpose of lawfully shooting deer or controlling vermin. 
 
This provision is one of the measures on which the Government said it proposed to take
action in addition to the recommendations made by Lord Cullen set out in the previous
section of this paper. In its initial response the Government said that the exception to the
prohibition on expending ammunition would extend only to shooting deer.47 The use of
firearms to shoot deer is controlled in England and Wales under the Deer Act 1991 and in
Scotland under the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959, as amended by the Deer (Scotland)
(Amendment) Act 1982. 
In his report, Lord Cullen made the following remarks about hollow-point ammunition:48 
    
9.115 During the course of the inquiry there was some controversy as to
the status and acceptability of hollow-point ammunition which is commonly
used in target shooting in Great Britain. The object of such a bullet is to
maximise the transmission of energy to achieve "stopping power" and
minimise over penetration. As part of his evidence to the Inquiry Mr Penn
explained that it was undesirable in police or self-defence use that a bullet
should exit from its target, or exit with any significant residual energy. since
this placed innocent third parties at risk. It was also desirable that bullets

that miss their intended targets should penetrate wood. brick, etc fully so
that risks to third parties were reduced. As I recorded in chapter 3 of this
report this type of ammunition formed part of what Thomas Hamilton
brought with him to the school. On balance I am not satisfied that I should
make any recommendation in regard to the availability of such ammunition.
Notification of the transfer or disposal of firearms 
Clauses 27 to 29 are concerned with shotguns as well as firearms. Clause 27 applies where,
"in the United Kingdom" a firearm or ammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act applies
or a shotgun is transferred to another person who is neither a registered firearms dealer nor
a person entitled to purchase or acquire the firearm or ammunition without a certificate.
Clause 27(2) provides that in such cases:
a) the transferee must produce to the transferor the certificate entitling him
to purchase or acquire, the firearm or ammunition, being transferred;
b) the transferor must comply with any instructions contained in the
certificate produced by the transferee;
c) the transferor must hand the firearm or ammunition to the transferee, and
the transferee must receive it, in person
"Firearm or ammunition" in clause 27(2) is presumably intended to include shotguns, as the
Clause as a whole applies to the transfer of shotguns, although this is not entirely clear. In
addition, the Clause refers to the "United Kingdom", which includes Northern Ireland,
although neither the Bill itself nor the 1968 Act to which the Clause refers extend to Northern
Ireland. 
Clause 28 similarly applies where "in the United Kingdom", any firearm to which section 1
applies is sold, let on hire, lent or given; or any shotgun is sold, let on hire or given, or lent
for a period of more than 72 hours. It will require any party to the transfer who is the holder
of a certificate relating to the firearm in question to give notice to the chief officer of police
who granted his certificate within 7 days of the transfer. The notice will have to contain a
description of the firearm in question , including its identification number, if any, the nature
of the transaction and the name and address of the other party. It will have to be sent by
registered post or the recorded delivery service.
Clause 29 is intended to require the holders of firearm or shotgun certificates to notify the
chief officer of police who granted the certificate within 7 days of the firearm or shotgun
being de-activated, destroyed or lost, or of ammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act
applies and to which the firearm certificate relates being lost. Where the weapon or
ammunition is lost, notification will be necessary whether the loss occurred as a result of theft
or otherwise. The notice will have to describe the firearm or ammunition, giving the
47


Research Paper 96/102
identification number, if any, and will have to be sent by registered post or the recorded
delivery service. 
A person who fails to comply with the requirements of Clause 27(2), who fails to give the
notice required by Clause 28 or who fails, without reasonable excuse to give the notice
required by Clause 29 will commit an offence. The penalties for these offences are set out
in Clause 30. The offences are all punishable, if committed in relation to a firearm or
ammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, by up to six months\' imprisonment
and a £5,000 fine following summary conviction and by up to five years\' imprisonment and
a fine following conviction on indictment. If committed in relation to a shotgun the offence
will be punishable on summary conviction by up to six months\' imprisonment and a £5,000
fine.
Changes to Firearm and Shotgun Certification Procedures
Clause 31 of the Bill sets out the manner in which applications for firearm certificates and
shotgun certificates are to be made. It will replace current provisions in Section 26 of the
Firearms Act 1968, which cover both firearm and shotgun certificates, with a Section 26A
concerned with applications for firearm certificates and Section 26B concerned with
applications for shotgun certificates. Like the present Section 26, the new Sections will enable
the Secretary of State to make rules under Section 53 of the 1968 Act requiring applicants
for firearm and shotgun certificates to provide up to four photographs and to fulfill certain
other requirements.
Where shotgun certificates are concerned these will be much the same as they are at present,
with applicants being required to provide verification by another person in a prescribed
manner of prescribed particulars, and the person verifying those particulars making a
statement that he knows of no reason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess
a shotgun.
Where firearm certificates are concerned rules made under the new Section 26A will require
an applicant to provide two referees (rather than one as at present) who may be required to
verify prescribed particulars in a prescribed manner, make statements that they know of no
reason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess a firearm and provide "such other
statements or information in connection with the application as may be prescribed"
 The period of time for which a firearm or shotgun currently remains in force was increased
from three years to five years in 1994 by the Firearms (Period of Certificate) Order 199449
and the Firearms (Scotland) (Amendment) Rules 199450. Schedule 2(4) of the Bill inserts a
                                                                                                                                                                                            
49 SI 1994/2614 
50 SI 1994/3198

Research Paper 96/102
new Section 28A into the Firearms Act 1968, subsection(1) of which will provide that:
A certificate shall, unless previously revoked or cancelled, continue in force
for five years from the date on which it was granted or last renewed, but
shall be renewable for a further period of five years by the chief officer of
police for the area in which the holder resides. 
The new Section 28A will also permit the Secretary of State to make orders substituting
other periods for the five year period set out in subsection (1) This power will be exercisable
by statutory instrument subject to annulment under the negative procedure. Such orders will
apply only to certificates granted or renewed after the date on which th order comes into
force.
Where a chief officer of police refuses to grant or renew a certificate there will be a right of
appeal, as there is at present, to the Crown Court in England and Wales or the sheriff in
Scotland.
Where at present it is an offence under Section 26(5) of the 1968 Act (punishable by up to
six months\' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine) for a person to make any statement which he
knows to be false for the purpose of procuring, whether for himself or any other person, the
grant or renewal of a certificate, it will be a similarly punishable offence, by virtue of new
Section 28A(7) of the 1968 Act for a person knowingly or recklessly to make any statement
which is "false in any material particular" for such a purpose. 
Clause 32 of the Bill will replace Section 27(1) of the Firearms Act 196851 with a new
subsection stating that a firearm certificate shall be granted where the chief officer of police
is satisfied:
a) that the applicant is fit to be entrusted with a firearm to which Section 1 applies and is not a person
prohibited by this Act from possessing such a firearm;
b) that he has a good reason for having in his possession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or
ammunition in respect of which the application is made; and
c) that in all the circumstances the applicant can be permitted to have the firearm or ammunition in his
possession without danger to the public safety or to the peace.
Clause 33 of the Bill is designed to replace Section 30 of the Firearms Act 1968, which is
concerned with the revocation of firearm and shotgun certificates, with a number of new
provisions. Arrangement for the revocation of shotgun certificates, set out in a new Section
30C, will not be significantly changed. A chief officer of police will, as now, be able to
revoke a shotgun certificate if he is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by the 1968 Act
from possessing a shotgun or cannot be permitted to possess a shotgun without danger to the

public safety or peace. A person aggrieved by the revocation of a shotgun certificate will be
able to appeal under Section 44 of the 1968 Act.
Where firearm certificates are concerned a new Section 30A will enable a chief officer of
police to revoke a firearm certificate in the following circumstances:
30A.-(1) A firearm certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of
police for the area in which the holder resides on any of the grounds
mentioned in subsections (2) to (5) below.
(2) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police has
reason to believe-
(a) that the holder is of intemperate habits or unsound mind or is
otherwise unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm; or
(b) that the holder can no longer be permitted to have the firearm or
ammunition to which the certificate relates in his possession without danger
to the public safety or to the peace.
(3) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police is
satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act from possessing a firearm
to which section I of this Act applies.
(4) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police is
satisfied that the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his
possession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or ammunition which
he is authorised by virtue of the certificate to have in his possession or to
purchase or acquire.
(5) A firearm certificate may be revoked if the holder fails to comply
with a notice under section 29(1) of this Act requiring him to deliver up the
certificate.
The provision enabling a certificate to be revoked of the chief officer of police is satisfied
that the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his possession, or for purchasing
or acquiring the firearm or ammunition authorised under the certificate is designed to
implement Lord Cullen\'s recommendation that greater consistency be achieved between the
provisions in Section 27(1) of the 1968 Act concerning the grant or renewal of firearm
certificates and those in Section 30 setting out the circumstances in which such certificates
may be revoked.52 A new Section 30B will also enable a firearm certificate to be partially
revoked (where the holder has more than one firearm) where the chief officer of police is
satisfied that the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his possession, or for
purchasing or acquiring the firearm or ammunition to which it relates. Lord Cullen
                                                                                                                                                                                            
52 Cm 3386 paras 8.31

Research Paper 96/102
recommended that provision be made for partial revocation.53 A person aggrieved by the
partial or full revocation of a certificate will be able to appeal under Section 44 of the 1968
Act unless, in the case of a full revocation, the revocation is the result of the holder\'s failure
to comply with a notice under Section 29 (1) requiring him to deliver up his certificate so
that it can be varied. 
Where a firearm or shotgun certificate is revoked the chief officer of police will, as now, have
to write to the holder giving him notice that he is required, in the case of a full revocation,
to surrender his certificate and in the case of a partial revocation, to deliver it up so that it
can be amended. It will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to
£1,00054 for the holder to fail to comply with a notice within 21 days from the date of the
notice. 
Powers of Entry, Search and Seizure
Clause 34 of the Bill is designed to replace Section 46 of the Firearms Act 1968, which
enables a magistrate (or a sheriff in Scotland) to grant a search warrant authorising police
constables to enter and search property and seize and detain firearms and ammunition. At
present the power to issue warrants is restricted to situations where a magistrate or sheriff is
satisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an
offence relevant for the purpose of the Section (which is most offences under the Firearms
Act 1968) has been, is being or is about to be committed.
Clause 34 will extend the power under Section 46 by also enabling warrants to be issued
where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that, in connection with a firearm or
ammunition, there is a danger to public safety or to the peace. Warrants will permit the
powers of entry, search and seizure to be used by civilian officers as well as police
constables. As well as being able, as they are at present, to seize firearms or ammunition
which they find on the premises or on people they reasonably suspect in relation to firearms
offences, police constables (or civilian officers) will be able to seize imitation firearms,
firearm or shotgun certificates and any other document authorising the possession, purchase,
acquisition, manufacture, sale or transfer of any firearm or ammunition. The extension to
these areas of the power of search under Section 46 of the 1968 Act was recommended by
Lord Cullen in his report (see p.41-42 above).55
It will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months\' imprisonment
and a £5,000 fine for a person to obstruct a constable or civilian officer in the exercise of

D. Guns clubs - Part II of the Bill
1. Background
The Home Affairs Select Committee Report on hand guns56 noted that there were \'over 2,500
rifle or pistol clubs in England, Scotland and Wales\' (para. 47). A footnote noted that there
were 2,118 rifle and pistol clubs "approved" by the Home Office/Scottish Office in England,
Wales and Scotland and it was estimated that there were several hundred "non-approved
clubs".57
The Home Affairs Committee Report noted that many clubs did not have suitable sites for
storage (para. 66). It also noted that little or no research was available on the rate of offences
committed in approved clubs compared to those committed in non-approved clubs (para. 95).
Further details on rifle and pistol clubs was given in an extract from the Home Office
Research and Planning Unit 1993 publication:58
Numbers of clubs
Accurate accounts of the numbers of rifle and pistol clubs are rare, but it has been possible
to get some idea of their changes over the last quarter century by looking at how many clubs
were affiliated at different times to target shooting associations. The oldest is the National
Rifle Association (NRA), founded in 1859, which had 800 miniature, as well as full-bore, rifle
clubs affiliated to it in 1920. In 1971 there were 580 clubs, 105 schools (mostly cadet corps),
and 90 associations in membership. By 1980 the number of clubs had grown to 832 and in
1990 the figure stood at 982. In 1992 there were 1,000 clubs and 90 cadet corps affiliated to
the NRA, representing some 60,000 shooters, and there were 4,500 individual members. In
addition, there were affiliated associations. The NRA is now mostly concerned with full-bore
centre-fire firearms. The majority (about 84 per cent) of its rifle and pistol clubs are
approved. Those clubs participating in the survey had an average (median) size of 40
members.
The Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs broke away from the NRA in the early part of this
century and in 1920 had 2,000 clubs affiliated to it. The Society later became the National
Small-Bore Rifle Association (NSRA) which, like the NRA, is a governing body recognized
by the Sports Council. In 1965 there were about 4,000 clubs affiliated to the NSRA but by
1970 this had dropped to 3,160 (of which 2,700 were approved). This represented club
membership of 111,000 (45,000 under 18 and 66,000 aged 18 and over). In 1971 3,600 clubs
were affiliated, some 650 of which were junior clubs. The number of affiliated clubs fell to
1,990 in 1990. By 1992 the number was down to 1,600 representing club membership of
25,000. In addition there were 35,000 belonging to junior clubs. The NSRA is primarily
concerned with air weapons, pistol and .22 rifle shooting. Some 79 per cent of its rifle and

Research Paper 96/102
pistol clubs are currently approved. The average (median) size of clubs participating in the
survey affiliated to this association was about 24.
The National Pistol Association (NPA) broke away from the NRA about 1970 and by 1980
there were 106 clubs affiliated, with a membership of 5,000. The number of affiliations has
continued to grow, to 390 clubs with a membership of 24,500 in 1985 and to 500 clubs with
a membership of 36,000 in 1992. Most of the clubs are thought to be approved. The average
(median) size was 59 members.
A memorandum by the Secretary of State and the Home Secretary for the Home Affairs
Select Committee summarised the current position as follows:
RIFLE AND PISTOL CLUBS
39. A member of a rifle or pistol club which has been approved by the Secretary of State
may possess (but not purchase or acquire) a rifle or pistol without a certificate when engaged
as a member of that club in, or in connection with, target practice (section 15 of the 1988
Act). The Secretary of State\'s approval of a club is subject to it meeting a number of criteria,
revised at the beginning of 1996, which are set out in a leaflet.
40. There are a total of 2,118 approved clubs throughout Great Britain, 247 of them in
Scotland. To qualify for approval under section 15, a club must generally have at least 10
members. They vary greatly in size and there are differing estimates of the total approved
club membership. Many individuals belong to more than one club.
41. Full membership of an approved club effectively allows a person to shoot there, using
a rifle, revolver or pistol and the ammunition for it, without having a firearm certificate of
their own. There are four categories of approval-for full and small-bore rifle and for full and
small-bore pistol (including revolvers).
42. The guns and ammunition which club members use need not necessarily belong to
the club - they might, for instance, be the personal property of another club member who
holds a firearm certificate. A club member may also use his own firearms and ammunition,
held on a firearm certificate which the police have issued to him personally, at the club range.
43. It is usual for clubs to have their own firearms and ammunition for members to use.
These are generally listed on a firearm certificate which the police have issued to a responsible
member of the club, for instance its Chairman or Secretary. Under section 32(2) of the 1968
Act, the police issue this certificate without the usual fee.
44. The club approval criteria require all new members to be sponsored by at least one
existing club member. If not already experienced with firearms, the new member must go
through a period of probation lasting at least three months, during which they must be given
a course in the safe handling of firearms and attend and shoot regularly under supervision.
45. Club approval lasts for six years. Most club approvals lapsed, and had to be renewed,
in June 1992 (under section 15(9) of the 1988 Act). They therefore fall to be renewed again
in 1998. Renewal requires the club to complete a form ("form 124") and submit it to the
Home Office or Scottish Office via the police. This allows the police to inform the Home
Office or Scottish Office of how the club is run and whether they support the application.
46. A club\'s approval can be withdrawn at any time if police or other reports indicate that
54


Research Paper 96/102
it is not being run in accordance with the criteria or that there is any other difficulty with it.
Clubs are under no duty to pass to the police, or each other, information about members who
resign or are expelled, or about would-be members whom they have turned away.
47. The way in which clubs store their weapons and ammunition varies. Some have
secure stores at their ranges, at which they keep all their weapons and ammunition. In other
cases, club members who have suitable firearm certificates keep the club\'s firearms and
ammunition securely at home. In all cases, the police must be satisfied that the arrangements
meet the requirement of the firearm certificate that firearm and ammunition be stored securely.
It is also a requirement of the club approval criteria that club firearms and ammunition "be
stored securely".
48. Some rifle and pistol clubs operate without approval under section 15. That is
perfectly proper, as long as all those who shoot at these clubs hold individual firearm
certificates and abide by their terms and conditions, which will specify the guns that they can
have in their possession and where they can shoot with them. The Government has no
information about the number and membership of clubs which operate in this way.
2. Current legislation
An extract from a report from the Research and Planning Unit of the Home Office59 sets out
the rules for the approval of rifle and pistol clubs:
Approval of rifle and pistol clubs by the Secretary of State
The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was introduced following a review of firearms
legislation after the Hungerford incident, Under Section 15 (1) of the Act, members of rifle
and pistol clubs which have been approved by the Secretary of State are exempted from
certain provisions of the legislation regarding firearms. Members of such clubs are permitted
to possess firearms and ammunition when engaged as a member of the club, in or in
connection with target practice, without holding a firearm certificate (FAC). A similar
exemption was introduced by the Firearms Act 1920, as was the concept of approved status,
and this has been re-enacted by subsequent legislation. There is no requirement for a club to
seek approval but only the members of approved clubs may benefit from the firearm certificate
exemption. Section 15 of the 1988 Act came into force on I July 1989 and introduced, for
the first time, a six year approval and renewal period and a fee for approval. It gave the
police, also for the first time, the right of entry to club premises. It caused the approval of
any club approved under Section 11(3) of the Firearms Act 1968 to expire on 30 June 1992.
In order to gain approval, a club is required to satisfy certain criteria laid down by the
Secretary of State. Essentially, prior to Section 15 coming into force in 1989, the Secretary
of State asked the police to check the bona fades of the club and confirm that a range safety
certificate covering the appropriate categories of weapons existed for each range used by the
club. Any premises where weapons were stored also had to be sufficiently secure.
Although members of an approved club may possess firearms and ammunition without holding
                                                                                                                                                                                            
59 Approval of Rifle and pistol target shooting clubs: the effects of the new and revised criteria - by John Martin
Corkery 1993 Home Office Research and Planning Unit Paper 79 
55


Research Paper 96/102
a certificate, the exemption does not extend to their purchase. In order for a club to purchase
firearms and ammunition a responsible officer of the club needs to hold an FAC. No fee is
payable for an FAC granted to a responsible member of an approved club, nor is any fee
payable for the variation or renewal of such a certificate.
Under Section 11(4) of the Firearms Act 1968 a person conducting or carrying on a miniature
rifle range (whether as a rifle club or otherwise) or shooting gallery at which no firearms are
used other than air weapons or miniature riles may possess, or purchase or acquire miniature
rifles and ammunition for them without holding a firearm certificate. Any person may use any
such miniature rifle and ammunition at such a range or gallery. Clubs operating as miniature
rifle ranges under Section 11(4) of the Act would gain no benefit from approval under Section
15(1).
Approval therefore indicates only that the club is equipped for the supervision and induction
of novice shooters; non-approved shooters are groups of certificate holders who meet to
pursue their shooting interests, and who do not seek to recruit novice shooters.
The criteria for approval were substantially revised in 1989 following two tragic shooting
incidents in the Greater Manchester Police area. The then Home Secretary, David
Waddington, felt that it was unacceptable for a casual caller to sign on at a club as a day or
temporary member and have immediate access to firearms and ammunition. Following
consultations with the Firearms Consultative Council,60 the revised criteria were issued to all
approved clubs on 15 March 1990 in England and Wales and 5 April 1990 in Scotland. They
were reviewed again in 1995 and the concept of \'novice\' membership abolished in favour of
\'probationary\' membership from 1 January 1996. The period of probation was reduced from
the 6 months operative for \'novice\' membership to three months. A new requirement that
members, prospective members and guests must sign a declaration to say that they are not
prohibited from possessing a firearm was added and the number of days on which a club
could allow non-members to shoot as individually supervised guests was increased from 4 a
year to 12.
The current criteria are set out in an extract from the Home Office leaflet Firearms: Approval
of Pistol and Rifle Clubs:61
Criteria for Approval
Clubs will not be granted approval unless they meet
the criteria which ore set out below. Approved
clubs which cease to conform to the criteria can 
expect that the approval will be withdrawn. The
criteria are:
 the club is a genuine rifle or pistol club with a
written constitution;
                                                                                                                                                                                            
60 a statutory body set up under S.22 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 to review the provisions of the
Firearms Acts and make recommendations for improving their working 
61 the Cullen inquiry noted that it would be preferable to have an explicit statutory provision for the issuing of
criteria for approval [para. 8.53] 
56


Research Paper 96/102
 the principal officers of the club are
responsible persons who can be entrusted with
the proper administration of the club;
 the club has at least 10 members of the time of
application for approval and at all times whilst,
approved unless, exceptionally, the Secretary of
State determines that there are special
circumstances which justify a lesser number;
 members must be of good character;
 members, prospective members and guests
must be asked to sign a declaration to say that
they are not prohibited from possessing a
firearm or ammunition by virtue of section 21
of the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended). (This
will usually apply to persons who have served
a term of imprisonment);
 the club has regular use of ranges with safely
certificates for the categories of firearm in
respect of which approval is sought or given,
as the case may be;
 the security arrangement for the storage of club
firearms and ammunition are satisfactory,
 the club does not run a day or temporary
membership scheme;
 the club does not have more than 12 guest
days a year. Guest members must be either
members of a recognised outside organisation
(see note 8 below) or individuals who are
known personally to at least one full member
of the club;
 guests must be supervised on a one-to-one
basis at all times when handling firearms and
ammunition, by either a full club member or
someone who is a coach with a qualification
recognised by the Great Britain Target
Shooting Federation and governing bodies.
The club secretary must notify each guest day
to the police firearms licensing department of
the area in which the guest day is to take
place, at least 48 hours in advance;
 anyone who applies for probationary
membership must be sponsored by at least one
full club member;
 before becoming a full member, individuals
must have a probationary period of at least 3
months during which time they must attend
and shoot regularly. The probationary member
must be given a course in the safe handling
and use of firearms on a one-to-one basis by
someone who is either a full member of the
club or who is a coach with a qualification
recognised by the Great Britain Target
Shooting Federation and governing bodies;
 once a probationary member has satisfactorily
completed a course in the safe handling and
use of firearms, he/she must be supervised at
all times when in possession of firearms or
ammunition by either the range officer, or a
full member of the club, or someone who is a
coach with a qualification recognised by the
Great Britain Target Shooting Federation and
governing bodies;
 the probationary period may be waived, at the
Club\'s discretion, for someone who
- is already a full member of another club
which has been approved by the Secretary
of State in respect of the same type or
types of firearm; or
- holds a firearm certificate; or
- has handled firearms in the course of
his/her duty in the police or the armed
services, and has a statement from his/her
existing or former senior/commanding
officer saying that he/she is fully trained
in handling the type of firearms in respect
of which the club has obtained approval
and is able to use them safely without
supervision;
 the club never has more probationary members
than full members unless the Secretary of State
determines that there are special circumstances
which justify a greater number of probationary
members; and
 there is nothing else that would make the club
57


Research Paper 96/102
unsuitable for approval.
Notes on the Criteria
1. The club must be a genuine rifle and
pistol club, set up for the purpose of target
practice. The constitution of the club
should implement the requirements of the
criteria.
2. Clubs should make their own
arrangements for assessing whether
members or prospective members are of
good character. Police firearms licensing
departments should not be asked to
disclose whether someone has a criminal
record or not. Prospective members
should not be required to apply for a
firearm or shot gun certificate as a means
of determining \'good character\'. The
police will not normally grant a certificate
because somebody is a probationary
member of a club.
3. The National Associations are able to
provide advice on the construction and use
of ranges. Clubs which are affiliated to
the National Rifle Association or the
National Small Bore Association will be
able to obtain a safety certificate for their
range from the Ministry of Defence.
4. Recognised coaching qualifications for the
purposes of the Home and Scottish Office
criteria for approved clubs are
Great Brita in Target Shooting
Federation - Coach Educator, Advanced
Coach, Senior Coach and Primary Coach;
National Rifle Association - Club
Instructor (Rifle), Club Instructor (Pistol)
and Range Conducting Officer; and
National Small-bore Rifle Association -
Range Conducting Officer, Range
Conducting Officers Assessor, Cadet Adult
Instructor and Regional Coaches.
5. The National Associations are able to give
advice on safety training courses for
probationary members.
6. A club may end a probationer\'s
membership at any time or extend the
probationary period if it considers that this
is necessary.
7. The Secretary of State may, in exceptional
cases such as university or college clubs -
allow a club to have more probationary
members than full members.
8. Examples of recognised outside
organisations whose members may be
guest members of approved rifle and pistol
clubs are Scouts and Guides, schools,
Rotary Clubs and Women\'s Institutes.
9. Clubs can have non-shooting categories of
membership such as associate, family,
social or honorary members. Such
members are not covered by section 15 of
the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and
must not, under any circumstances, have
any access to firearms or ammunition.
The Cullen inquiry62 noted that unapproved clubs were not subject to any form of inspection:
8.39 At the same time it has to be borne in mind that some rifle and
pistol clubs. the exact number of which is not known, operate without the
need for approval under section 15. In such clubs the participants should all
                                                                                                                                                                                            
62 The Public Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 Cm 3386

Research Paper 96/102
have their own firearm certificates and are expected individually to abide by
their terms and conditions. Such clubs are in themselves not subject to
legislation, and are not subject to any form of statutory inspection. Mr D J
Penn pointed out that some of these "clubs" amount to no more than a
means by which a group of people who share an interest in a certain type
of firearm or competition get together on an informal basis on certain
occasions during the year.
Police powers to visit and enter rifle clubs vary according to status; "approved" clubs can be
inspected to ascertain whether the conditions on which approval is granted is being complied
with63 but there is no equivalent power to inspect non-approved clubs.64
Detailed guidance to the police on rifle and pistol clubs and cadet corps was given in
Firearms Law: Guidance to the Police HMSO 1989, Chapter 13. The Guidance covers
matters such as siting of ranges, security of club premises and administration of clubs, and
notes that general approval to Combined Cadet Forces, Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force
and Air Training Corps has been granted under S.11(3) of the 1988 Act.
3. The Cullen Report recommendations for gun clubs
The Cullen Report did not recommend the wholesale prohibition of guns, but considered
improvements to the certification system and discussed the need for each holder of a firearm
certificate to be a member of at least one approved club, and for approved clubs to keep a
record of the activities of their members who are holders of firearm certificates, and to inform
the police of the termination of membership or non-attendance for a substantial period. The
Government response to Cullen (Cm 3392) accepted the following recommendation on gun
clubs:
10. Each club which is approved for the purposes of section 15 of the Firearms
(Amendment) Act 1988 should he required to maintain a register of the attendance of its
members who are holders of firearm certificates, together with details as to the firearms
which they used and the competitions in which they participated when they attended.
The Government accepts this recommendation. The approval criteria for clubs will be
amended (see recommendation 15).
11. Every holder of a firearm certificate should be required to be a member of at least
one approved club; and the firearm certificate should specify the approved club or clubs
of which he or she is a member and the firearms which he or she intends to use in each
of them.
The Government accepts this recommendation, for holders of firearm certificates for target

shooting. The Government will bring forward the necessary changes in primary legislation.
12. Each approved club should be required to inform the police when a holder of a
firearm certificate has ceased to be a member of the club for whatever reason.
13. Each approved club should be required to inform the police when a member who is
the holder of a firearm certificate has not attended a meeting of the club for a period of
a year.
14. The proposal that each club should appoint a person to act as a liaison officer with
the police is endorsed.
The Government accepts these 3 recommendations and will amend the approval criteria for
clubs (see recommendation 15).
15. Explicit statutory provision should be made for the laying down of criteria for the
approval of clubs for the purpose of section 15 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988.
The Government accepts this recommendation. The Government intends to give statutory
force to the approval criteria for clubs (amended in line with recommendations 10, 12 to 14,
19 and 20).
4. Part II of the Bill - the details
In the statement following publication of the Cullen Report Michael Howard, the Home
Secretary, proposed that high calibre hand guns no longer remain in private ownership, and
that low calibre hand guns (22 rimfire hand guns) would have to be used and kept in licensed
clubs.65
The clubs in which it will still be possible to
use .22 handguns will be subject to the most
stringent security standards. We shall consult as a
matter of urgency chief constables and other
interested parties on the details of the standards,
and we shall set them out clearly in guidance. In
addition, every individual club will need to be
approved by the chief constable of the area in
which it is situated. Handguns will be able to be
removed from a club only for strictly limited
purposes, which will be specified in law, and under
the most stringent controls.
Few, if any, existing gun clubs will be able to
meet those requirements. When the powers become
law, we shall therefore require any owner of a .22
rimfire handgun to hand his gun to the police for
safekeeping until he is able to find a licensed club
that he can join. We shall then provide a period
for clubs to improve their security, and to be
inspected and licensed. Some handgun clubs may
never be able to achieve an adequate level of
security. If so, they will have to close.
                                                                                                                                                                                            
65 HC Deb vol 282 16/10/96 c.833-834

Research Paper 96/102
In response Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, said that the Government proposal was an
unsatisfactory compromise:66
The problem with the compromise on clubs
proposed by the Secretary of State is that there will
still be 40,000 handguns, including many
semiautomatics, remaining in private ownership-
albeit for use in clubs. I am aware that the
Secretary of State proposes tight new controls on
the gun clubs that are allowed to remain. Is he not
aware of a most compelling case made against the
halfway house by the British Shooting Sports
Council in its evidence to the inquiry, in paragraph
9.68 on page 121? Referring to the crucial issue of
the booking out of weapons, even with tighter
controls, the BSSC said:
"no matter what system of checks and paperwork is
maintained in such circumstances, it would be a simple
matter indeed for a shooter intent in recovering his guns to
enter a competition, provide evidence to his club secretary
that he had done so, recover possession of the complete gun
together with ammunition for it, and perpetrate an outrage".
In the light of that evidence not least, I ask the
Secretary of State to think again about the proposal
to allow the licensing of some gun clubs before the
Bill is published.
In response to a question from Alan Beith MP, Mr Howard said that he envisaged that the
transportation of guns from one club to another would be permitted in "only the most limited
circumstances and under the most stringent controls. For instance, the transportation should
be effected not by the owner of the gun but by a third party specifically authorised for that
purpose" (c.837).
The Bill allows for the establishment of licensed gun clubs once a target pistol shooting club
has proved that it can merit the necessary criteria. Clause 13 provides that no small calibre
pistols are allowed on club premises unless the club has a licence and the holder of the
certificate relating to the pistol is a member of the club and the premises are specified in the
certificate as those where the gun is to be stored and used. Pistol clubs will therefore have
to become licensed clubs in order to operate in future. Clause 13(3) provides that an offence
is committed where a small calibre pistol is used or stored in contravention of the Clause,
with imprisonment for up to 6 months or a £5,000 fine. Clause 14 will allow the responsible
officer of a licensed club to store and handle members\' pistols without a firearms certificate
for those pistols.67
The granting of licences is governed by Clause 15 which provides for the Secretary of State
to grant a licence in respect of the club and club premises. A fee of £150 would be payable.
Clause 16 enables the Secretary of State to publish guidance on the criteria for licences for
the purposes of informing applicants. A licence may only be granted if the Secretary of State
is satisfied that the arrangements for storing and using small calibre pistols are such that their
storage or use will not endanger the public safety or the peace, following consultations with
the chief officer of police for the area in which the premises are situated. No official detail

67 the term "responsible officer" is defined in Clause 12. See the note on Clause 21 on the following page

Research Paper 96/102
is available at present about the criteria for licences. Clause 17 provides that the licence is
to be granted subject to conditions for ensuring public safety and the peace, and an offence
is committed if the conditions are not complied with. Licences are to last for 5 years, but
will be removable for further periods of 5 years. There is power in Clause 18(2) for the
Secretary of State to substitute shorter or longer periods by order. The Secretary of State may
vary the terms and conditions of a licence if he thinks fit under Clause 19 and revoke the
licence under Clause 20 at any time, if he thinks fit.
A pistol register will have to be kept by a "responsible officer" of a licensed pistol club under
Clause 21. A "responsible officer" is defined in Clause 12 as the officer of the club to whom
the licence was granted, or who has become the responsible officer following a variation in
the terms of the licence. The register will contain particulars of each pistol stored at the
premises, namely the name and address of the person authorised by the firearm certificate to
have the pistol in his possession; the date the pistol was first stored at the club; and the date
and time of the return of the pistol after removal.
The information on a pistols register will be kept for at least 5 years, as available for
inspection, and further particulars may be required by regulations to be made under Clause
22 which allows the Secretary of State to prescribe requirements in relation to licensed pistol
clubs and their operation, impose obligations in the responsible officer or persons responsible
for the management of a licensed pistol club and impose obligations on those authorised
under S.14(2) to handle members\' pistols without a certificate. No further detail is available
on the regulations which may be issued under this Clause. The regulations will be subject
to annulment by either House of Parliament under the negative resolution procedure for S.Is.
Authorised police officers will have the power of entry and inspection under Clause 23 to
ascertain that the legislation conditions on a licence are being complied with and Clause 24
makes it an offence to make a false statement for the purpose of obtaining a licence.
Finally, in Part III of the Bill Clause 36 substitutes a new Section 15 for the Firearms
(Amendment) Act 1988 which makes clear that pistol clubs can no longer receive approval
under S.15 since they must be licensed under Part II of the Bill. The new wording for S.15
will also give specific statutory authorisation for the Secretary of State to publish guidance
about the criteria to be applied with regard to the approval of rifle clubs under S.15 thus
fulfilling the recommendation in the Cullen Report (see above p.56-57).

Research Paper 96/102
There is no provision in the Bill for compensation to be paid for pistol clubs which may have
to close if they cannot meet the criteria for licensing, nor are there proposals for grants to
assist towards the cost of providing secure premises for small calibre pistols. In the
Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill the business compliance cost assessment
notes that the Bill "will result in increased costs for clubs which choose to become licensed
pistol clubs. The level of costs involved will depend on the extent of their existing security
arrangements and the precise requirements which will be imposed under the Bill. These costs
cannot currently be quantified". Government amendments were introduced to the 1988
Firearms (Amendment) Act during the passage of the Bill to compensate owners of weapons
which would be prohibited under the 1988 Act, but the Government emphasised that it could
not be regarded as any sort of precedent.68

Research Paper 96/102
E. Compensation
The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 brought high powered self-loading rifles, burst fire
weapons and repeating short-barrelled smooth-bore guns within the prohibited category under
S.5 of the Firearms Act 1968, which means that special authority is required from the
Secretary of State to possess or deal with them. The question of compensation for those who
had lawfully held such firearms was raised early in proceedings on the Bill which became the
1988 Act, and which, as first presented, contained no provisions to allow such payments. The
White Paper, Firearms Act 1968: Proposals for Reform69 had taken a firm line on the
question of compensation:
47. The Government has also looked carefully at the question of compensation for those
people who now own weapons which will become prohibited. We have concluded that as a
matter of principle it is undesirable and unjust to require the taxpayer at large to pay for the
removal from the public domain of weapons which are an acknowledged threat to life.
Although there will be no market for prohibited weapons in this country, authorised dealers
will still be able to export them abroad, and owners will be able to recover some of the value
in this way. Where they choose not to do so, facilities will be provided for them to be handed
in to the police in the course of the forthcoming firearms amnesty.
On second reading, on 21 January 1988, the Home Secretary Douglas Hurd pointed out that
".... On the occasions when certain products have been banned by domestic or European
legislation, no compensation has been paid, and it would therefore be inequitable to pay it in
this instance".70 Considerable pressure during the debate on the Money Resolution resulted
in an undertaking to look again at the question, but it was made clear during the first sitting
of Standing Committee F on 4 February 1988, when the sittings motion was lost, that
progress on the relevant clauses would depend on a clear policy statement on the question of
compensation. At the beginning of the second sitting on 9 February 1988, Mr Hogg
announced the Government\'s agreement to the principle of a buy-in policy.71 The power to
make a scheme for payments in respect of prohibited weapons was provided by S.21 of the
Act.
Debates of the scheme were announced on 17 May 1988:72
Sir Eldon Griffiths: To ask the Secretary of
State for the Home Department whether he will
now publish details of the buy-in scheme in respect
of firearms whose prohibition is proposed in the
Firearms (Amendment) Bill.
Mr. Douglas Hogg: The proposed "buy-in"
scheme would operate for a period of three months
from the date on which the relevant provisions
came into force. Transitional arrangements would
be introduced to allow continuing possession of the
firearms involved during that period.

Payments under the scheme would be made to
persons in respect of firearms which would become
prohibited under the Bill and which were lawfully
held by them on a firearm or shotgun certificate on
or before 22 September 1987, when my right hon.
Friend announced the Government\'s intentions in a
speech to the Association of Police Superintendents.
Certificate holders who acquired such firearms after
that date because of a previous binding contract to
purchase would also be accommodated where
evidence of the contract could be produced. In
addition, such holders who acquired them before
and sold them after 22 September 1987 would be
eligible upon production of evidence of sale.
Claimants would be required to complete a
claim form obtainable from a police station or rifle
or pistol club and to surrender the qualifying
firearm(s). They would also have to produce the
relevant firearm or shotgun certificate to the issuing
police force, and police records would be noted
accordingly.
We expect that most claims would be for self-
loading rifles. For these, two options would be
available. Claimants could apply for a fixed sum
payment of £150. This figure takes account of the
price which self-loading rifles of the Kalashnikov
and equivalent models would have fetched at
auction before my right hon. Friend\'s
announcement of 22 September 1987. 
Alternatively, for the small number of firearms of
considerably higher value, claimants could provide
evidence of the purchase price or insurance value.
Payment under this option would be 50 per cent. of
the average retail value of the firearm in the
summer of 1987. This formula is designed to
produce the amount which in general an individual
might reasonably expect to have obtained on the
sale of the item at auction in the summer of 1987.
Claimants who sold self-loading rifles after 22
September 1987 would be paid the difference
between the sum received from the sale and the
sum determined by an application under whichever
of the two options were to be exercised.
In respect of all other firearms which would
become prohibited, payment would be available
only under the second option, and where
accompanied by the relevant documentary evidence.
Any case that could not be reasonably determined
by the application of these arrangements would be
considered at the discretion of my right hon.
Friend the Home Secretary, or in Scotland at the
discretion of my right hon. and learned Friend the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
We have proposed the scheme because of the
unique circumstances involved: namely, that
individuals would be prohibited from holding
firearms which they were previously authorised to
hold by the issue of a firearm or shotgun certificate
and which have lost most or all of their market
value. It cannot be regarded as any sort of
precedent.
S.21 of the 1988 Act came into force on 1 February 1989 and the scheme ran until 30 April
1989. Details of the number of firearms for which compensation was paid in England and
Wales and the costs involved were provided on 5 November 1996:73
Sir Jerry Wiggin: To ask the Secretary of
State for the Home Department how many guns
have been surrendered as a result of the
prohibitions introduced by the Firearms
(Amendment) Act 1988; how many claims for
compensation remain to be settled; and what was
the total cost of compensation paid to date.
Miss Widdecombe: The Department received
nearly 3,000 claims relating to around 3,600
firearms under the Government buy-in-scheme for
weapons which became prohibited by virtue of the
Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988. A total of
£620,000 was paid in relation to those claims. The
Department has considered all claims made under
the scheme and advised claimants of the outcome.
Offers have been made to all claimants entitled to
receive compensation.

Research Paper 96/102
The EC Directive on the Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Weapons came into
force for Great Britain on 1 January 1993. It was implemented by the Firearms Acts 1968
(Amendment) Regulations 199274 and prohibited the possession of disguised firearms such as
walking stick shotguns and guns shaped like cigarette lighters except by recognized collectors,
museums and others duly authorised. On this occasion, owners could apply for an ex-gratia
payment if they surrendered their disguised firearms to the police, and payments were to be
based on the market value that the firearm might reasonably have attained immediately before
the ban was announced.75
In July 1996, the Home Affairs Committee in their Report on the Possession of Hand-guns76
suggested that "If hand guns were to be banned, compensation might have to be paid to
owners who were required to surrender their firearms".77 The Secretary of State for Scotland
and the Home Secretary, in a joint memorandum of evidence, commented on suggestions for
change and particularly on the cost of compensation:78
34. Most of the suggestions above would lead to a requirement for the disposal of guns which
would no longer be able to be held legally. As in 1988, following the prohibitions imposed
by the Firearms (Amendment) Act of that year, the Government would need to consider a
scheme for buying in or otherwise compensating the owners of these guns.
35. The cost is hard to assess, since it would depend to a large extent on exactly what was
being compensated. The estimated number of handguns of one type or another legally held
on a police firearm certificate in Great Britain is in the order of 190,000. Handguns can be
high-value items-top of the range target pistols retail for up to £2,500, or more. Target pistol
owners may also have ancillary equipment, such as bullet-making machinery, which a
prohibition on pistols could render redundant. Firearms dealers would also be affected, in
some cases severely.
Later, in October 1996, the Cullen Report also commented on the potential cost of
compensating owners of hand guns should their possession be prohibited:79
9.104 The expropriation of hand guns would give rise to clams for compensation. Mr Paton
provided evidence as to their cost. He stated that prices for new self-loading pistols ranged
from £200 to £2,000 or more, with second-hand handguns ranging from £150 to £1,500 or
more. The most common price range for both new and second-handguns was from £300 to
£600. The cost of new revolvers ranged from £200 to £1,000 or more; with second-hand
ranging from £100 to £500 or more. The average range for new and second-hand revolvers
was between £150 and £500. By way of comparison, a single shot pistol ranged in price
between £200 and £2,000 or more; and second-hand from £50 upwards. Due to the limited
market for such guns it was not possible for him to estimate an average cost. It is also right

to take account of the money invested in accessories such as optical sights, holsters, carrying
boxes and security cabinets. In his submission Mr Colin Greenwood stated that in Great
Britain the annual sales of ammunition and related accessories approached £20 m: and that a
considerable number of jobs - such as in clubs, manufacturing and supplying, the gun trade
and the work of gunsmiths - were dependent on pistol shooting.
The Home Secretary\'s statement of 16 October 1996 on measures which could lead to the
destruction of 160,000 hand guns - "80 per cent of those legally held today" included the
undertaking that appropriate compensation would be paid for hand guns legally possessed.80
Under clause 10 of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill 1996-97, the Secretary of State may
make arrangements for "the orderly surrender at designated police stations" of firearms the
possession of which will become illegal, and clause 11 provides for a scheme of payments
to individuals in respect of prohibited small firearms surrendered:
11. The Secretary of State shall, in accordance with a scheme made by
him, make payments to persons who surrender firearms to a chief officer
of police-
(a) which they had, and were entitled to have in their possession on or
before ]6th October 1996 by virtue of firearm certificates held by
them or by virtue of their being registered firearms dealers; or
(b) which on or before that date they had contracted to acquire and
were entitled to have in their possession on and after that date by
virtue of such certificates held by them or by virtue of their being
registered firearms dealers,
and their possession of which will become, or has become, unlawful by
virtue of section 1 above.
The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill states that the effect on public expenditure of the
tighter controls on firearms and the prohibition of higher calibre hand guns will depend on
the amount of compensation which has to be paid:
Financial effects of the Bill
The proposals in the Bill provide tighter controls on firearms and
prohibit higher calibre handguns. Their effect on public expenditure will
depend largely upon the total amount of compensation that is paid out to
firearm owners and registered dealers. All costs are given at current prices.
It is expected that compensation at market value will need to be paid on
some 160,000 guns held by individuals and dealers which will become
prohibited weapons.
                                                                                                                                                                                            
80 HC Deb. 282, c.833
67


It is estimated that the total amount of compensation to be paid could
range between £25 million and £50 million.
In addition, there will be administrative costs for storing guns while
they are valued, and for handling compensation claims. It is estimated that
these will be between £3 million and £5 million.
Compensation payments are likely to start in April 1997. The bulk of
the administrative costs will fall in the financial year 1997/98. Some
funding would be necessary in 1996197 to set up the compensation scheme.
This would be absorbed within the Home Office Vote.
The Home Secretary\'s statement of 16 October did not, however, suggest that any
compensation would be payable to gun clubs unable to comply with new requirements:81
Few, if any, existing gun clubs will be able to meet
those requirements. When the powers become law, we
shall therefore require any owner of a .22 rimfire handgun
to hand his gun to the police for safekeeping until he is
able to find a licensed club that he can join. We shall
then provide a period for clubs to improve their security,
and to be inspected and licensed. Some handgun clubs
may never be able to achieve an adequate level of
security. If so, they will have to close.
It remains to be seen whether and to what extent the Sports Council will be able to make
National Lottery funding available in these circumstances. The Bill\'s business compliance
cost assessment states that the level of costs involved for clubs which choose to become
licensed pistol clubs will depend on existing security arrangements and how far they can
comply with new requirements: "These costs cannot currently be quantified". 
European Convention on Human Rights
Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights provides that:
Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his
possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public
interest and subject to the conditions provided by law and by the general
principles of international law.
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of
a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of
property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of
taxes or other contibutions or penalties. 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
81 HC Deb. 282, c.833 
68


This article is frequently invoked in proceedings brought under the European Convention, but
the European Court of Human Rights rarely finds that a violation has taken place. This is not,
perhaps, surprising in view of the wide range of permissible restrictions set out in the article.
Luke Clements has suggested that:82
Whilst the first paragraph [of article 1] delimits the situations in which
deprivation of possessions is permitted, the second paragraph almost
amounts to a presumption that some form of control over the enjoyment of
possessions is inevitable.
J.E.S Fawcett has noted that:83
What is surprising is that the Article does not clearly enunciate a right to
compensation for the taking of property, a principle which, though
sometimes honoured in the breach, is recognized in the greater part of the
world, including those countries that seek to apply Communist doctrines of
property ownership. It is left to extract, if it is possible, a right to
compensation out of the words \'no one shall be deprived of his possessions\';
but the preparatory work is not helpful here.
The issue of the relationship between measures to control firearms and the Bill of Rights 1689
is considered elsewhere in this Paper.
Amnesties
Since the beginning of controls on firearms in 1920, there have been nine amnesties: in 1933,
1935, 1937, 1946, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1988 and 1996. The authority for the 1988 amnesty was
explained by Mr Douglas Hogg on 19 December 1988, and this is a typical arrangement:84
Mr. William Ross: To ask the Secretary of
State for the Home Department under what powers
he acted in offering the recent firearms amnesty.
 Mr. Douglas Hogg: The amnesty had no
statutory basis. It amounted to an agreement by
chief officers of police, with the consent of my
right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General,
not to bring criminal proceedings for unlawful
possession against those who surrendered illegally
held firearms to the police during the period of the
amnesty.

The Consultation Paper of 1973 indicated that previous amnesties had been conducted on the
same basis, and warned against the dangers of too frequent amnesties:85
124. This Green Paper has set out the Government\'s proposals for
tightening the law on firearms. Legislation is not, however, the only means
by which the availability of firearms to criminals can be reduced. On seven
occasions since 1933 there have been firearms amnesties (that is, appeals for
the surrender of firearms coupled with assurances that those surrendering
them would not be prosecuted for possessing them without a certificate). An
amnesty provides those in illegal possession of firearms with an opportunity
to dispose of them without fear of prosecution, so reducing the number of
illegally held firearms in circulation. The practice has been for the Home
Secretary to consult chief officers of police about the desirability of an
amnesty, and then to ask them not to prosecute for illegal possession persons
handing in firearms during the amnesty. Corresponding action is taken in
Scotland. The last amnesty was held in 1968. immediately before the
provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 about shot gun certificates came
into operation; over one-third of the firearms handed in then were unwanted
shot guns.
125. The figures of firearms handed in during previous amnesties
suggest that there are considerable numbers of illegally held firearms which
will be handed in when their possessors are given the opportunity to do this
without fear of prosecution. If amnesties were too frequent, the impression
might be given that the illegal possession of firearms was not a serious
offence, and those holding firearms without certificates might be encouraged
to retain them in the belief that there would always be an opportunity to
hand them in next time there was an amnesty.
The last amnesty ran from 3 to 30 June 1996 and on 23 July 1996 the Home Secretary
announced in a written answer that nearly 23,000 firearms, 700,000 rounds of ammunition and
3,000 other weapons were surrendered to police forces in Great Britain.86 A Home Office
press notice of the same date revealed that the final figures for different types of weapons
were:
Rifles 1,859
Smooth-bore guns 8,649
Hand guns 4,442
Other firearms 7,989

The 1988 amnesty lasted for the month of September 1988, and its promotion was to cost
£500,000.87 A total of 42,725 firearms and 1,511,000 rounds of ammunition were surrendered
in England and Wales.88 This was considered to compare most favourably with the 1968
appeal which extended over three months when 25,088 firearms and 795,163 rounds of
ammunition were handed in. Notes to the press notice includes the fact that the substantial
majority of guns surrendered were of military origin, dating back to the Great War or World
War II. This had produced a high proportion of pistols and revolvers in the total and there
was a decline in the proportion of shotguns compared with 1968. In Scotland, 5,177 firearms
and 221,703 rounds of ammunition were surrendered in 1988 (ibid).
Weapons surrendered under ammesties are destroyed, except for those of historical
significance which were acquired by museums under special arrangements. None is offered
for sale.89
On 15 May 1996 Alex Carlile MP asked the Home Secretary what procedures other than a
national amnesty exist for members of the public to dispose of firearms that have been owned
or discovered without a licence. The answer read as follows:90
Whether to prosecute offences of unlawful possession
of firearms is a matter for the prosecuting authorities on a
case by case basis. But Home Office guidance to the
police is that no obstacle should be placed in the way of
individuals who wish to hand in unlicensed or unwanted
guns, even when an amnesty is not running. Our current
guidance, publicly available from Her Majesty\'s Stationery
Office since 1989 in "Firearms Law: Guidance to the
police", underlines this advice.

F. Firearms control and the Bill of Rights 1689
From time to time there have been assertions that the Bill of Rights 168991 may affect
statutory attempts at gun control, as contemplated in the present bill.92 This Section seeks
to explore, in general terms, some of the relevant constitutional issues. The detailed law of
possession of firearms is dealt with elsewhere in this paper.
Article 7
What is commonly described as article 7 of the Bill of Rights is as follows:
"Subject\'s arms -- That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their
defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law"
Schwoerer has neatly summarised the background and legislative history of this provision.93
In particular, she noted that the two qualifiers -- "suitable to their conditions" and "as allowed
by law" -- were amendments introduced by the House of Lords: "their effect was to limit the
right to bear arms to the Protestant upper classes, according to the laws already passed," and
she concluded that "in its final form, with the qualifying clauses, the article both reaffirmed
ancient laws in giving men the right to possess arms according to their social and economic
standing and declared new law in limiting the right to Protestants."94
Blackstone referred to the article in the general context of civil liberties in English law:95
5. The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I at present
mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition
and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the
same statute 1 W. & M. st. 2, c. 2, and it is indeed a public allowance under
due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when
the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the
violence of oppression.
                                                                                                                                                                                            
91 Sometimes dated 1688. There is a similar provision, although not in the positive terms of the English provision,
in the Scottish Claim of Right 1689: Stair Encyclopaedia, vol 10 para 1502. Doubt has been expressed as to the
application of the Bill of Rights to Northern Ireland; see G Lock, "The 1689 Bill of Rights", (1989) XXXVII
Political Studies 540, 557-8. The application of international law, such as the European Convention on Human
Rights, is not considered here (on which see, for example, Baroness Chalker\'s written answer, HL Deb vol 571
c.WA1, 1.4.96) 
92 For example, Mr Richard Munday, who submitted evidence to the Cullen Tribunal and the recent Home Affairs
Committee inquiry on hand guns, has analysed the relevant provisions in their historical and contemporary context.
This has apparently formed the basis of some of the arguments currently being put to Ministers and Members 
93 L Schwoerer, The declaration of rights 1689, 1981, pp74-8
94 p.78
95 W Blackstone, Commentaries, 21st ed, 1844 (by J Hargrave), pp143-4
72


  In these several articles consist the rights, or, as they are frequently termed,
the liberties of Englishmen: liberties, more generally talked of than
thoroughly understood; and yet highly necessary to be perfectly known and
considered by every man of rank or property, lest his ignorance of the points
whereon they are founded should hurry him into faction and licentiousness
on the one hand, or a pusillanimous indifference and criminal submission on
the other. And we have seen that these rights consist, primarily, in the free
enjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property.
So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every
species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one
or other of these rights, having no other object upon which it can possibly
be employed. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the
constitution of parliament be supported its full vigour; and limits, certainly
known, be set to the royal prerogative. And lastly, to vindicate these rights,
when actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in
the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the
courts of law; next, to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for
redress of grievances; and, lastly, to the right of having and using arms for
self-preservation and defence. And all these rights and liberties it is our
birthright to enjoy entire; unless where the laws of our country have laid
them under necessary restraints-restraints in themselves so gentle and
moderate, as will appear upon farther inquiry, that no man of sense or
probity would wish to see them slackened. For all of us have it in our
choice to do everything that a good man would desire to do; and are
restrained from nothing, but what would be pernicious either to ourselves or
our fellow-citizens.
The 1689 article has been cited inside and outwith Parliament at various times. For example,
during debates on what became the Seizure of Arms Act 181996, it was considered in some
detail. A protest against the bill in the Lords Journal cited both article 7 and Blackstone in
defence of British subjects\' rights to bear arms for their defence.97 During the Commons
committee stage, Canning, for the government, accepted the relevance of article 7, but
emphasised the qualifications in the provision:98
It was most true, as had been laid down, that
all subjects were entitled by the Bill of Rights to
have arms, but with one small qualification, which
he mentioned not in praise of, or with a view to
establish the qualifications, but as showing that at
the very time when our ancestors laid down the
principle they contemplated the exception. Those
who had cited the Bill of Rights had uniformly
omitted the important words- "All subjects being
Protestants have a right so to be armed." How had
it happened that in all the discussions for the last
three weeks, in all the public addresses for the last
three months, that clause had been carefully
excluded? What was to be inferred from those
words? - That the Papists ought now to be
disarmed? Certainly not: he only brought them
forward to illustrate the position, that this general
right, like every other, was subject to qualification;
and nothing could more satisfactorily prove its
subjectness to qualification than the fact, that at the
very moment the right was conferred it was actually
qualified. Though the current of opinion was at
                                                                                                                                                                                            
96 Some sources cite this as 1820

present against such an exception of the Catholics
he was not sure whether, by any subsequent law, it
had been repealed; but supposing it remained on
the Statute-book, that clause would exclude from
the possession of arms no small portion of the
inhabitants in some of the disturbed districts.
Would he then exempt the professors of the
Catholic religion from the right of having arms for
self-defence? No; he had always argued in a
contrary direction; but the Bill of Rights, correctly
quoted and properly construed, brought him to the
provision of the bill on the table, which, in fact,
recognised the general right of the subject to have
arms, but qualified that right in such a manner as
the necessity of the case required. As the Papists
at the Revolution, were armed against the existing
government, and were excepted in the Bill of
Rights, so the act before the House excepted the
disaffected in the disturbed districts who were in
arms against the law and authorities of the land. 
He appealed, therefore, to the Bill of Rights in
defence of the step he now called upon the House
to take; and he contended that it would only be to
carry into effect the very doctrines our forefathers
had shown that they admitted. In the spirit of the
Bill of Rights, he called upon the legislature to
interpose to suspend a right, and take away arms
that could not be held without danger to the
tranquillity of the state. 
Greenwood\'s 1972 study, Firearms control, analysed the application of the 1689 provision as
part of a general history of firearms regulation.99 He noted that "the bill did not seek to
disarm Catholics, but merely to ensure that discrimination against Protestants in the matter
of keeping arms for their defence should cease", and considered the legal context of the
provision: "As with most of the great constitutional milestones, the Bill of Rights must be
carefully considered against the conditions of the times."100 He cited the extract from
Blackstone, and concluded:101
Blackstone\'s Commentaries were then, and indeed still are, regarded as the
definitive statement of the Common Law. In matters relating to Common
Law they are still quoted with authority in the highest courts. His study of
the Common Law and the Constitution as it relates to the right to have arms
must, therefore, be accepted as indeed it was by later English governments-
as an accurate assessment of the state of the law at the time of writing. The
right to keep arms appears to have persisted until the twentieth century and
the effect of the Constitution on twentieth-century laws and practice is a
matter for discussion under that heading. Certainly the right was jealously
preserved by parliament during the nineteenth century.

In his evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, he summarised his argument in the following
terms:102
12. Early English legislation relating to firearms was concerned only with the duty of the
citizen to arm himself for the defence of the realm and for the maintenance of order. Early
legislation restricting the use of it was concerned only with the maintenance of compulsory
practice with the longbow or with the preservation of game. There was a clear and recognised
right, as well as a duty for the subject to have arms for his own protection and to discharge
his duty to the state, though those arms would not necessarily have been firearms.
13. The Bill of Rights of 1688 made it perfectly clear that Parliament considered that
there was a right for citizens to have arms (page 11) and by the mid 18th century the Common
Law was very clear in recognising a Constitutional right to have arms which Parliament had
no authority to breach in general terms (page 12). In the early 19th century, perceived dangers
of major disorder resulted in the "Six Acts" amongst which was the Seizure of Arms Act 1820
which appeared to abrogate the right to keep arms. Debates in Parliament (pages 14 and 15)
made it clear that the Government accepted that there was indeed a right to keep arms but
their view was that the Constitution allowed for qualification of that right for a limited period
and in specified area. The Seizure of Arms Act automatically lapsed after two years and was
applied only to specified areas of the country. Until the start of the 20th century, therefore,
the right to keep arms was vigorously upheld by Parliament and all attempts at legislation to
restrict arms generally or firearms in particular failed completely.
In R v Dewhurst (1820) 1St Tr NS 529 (a criminal case of unlawful assembly etc), Bayley
J, summing up, said, inter alia:103 
On the subject of carrying arms the learned
judge said: Gentlemen, I forgot to observe to you
on the subject of carrying arms that I do not agree
with the counsel on the part of the defendants that
persons have a right to carry arms in the way in
which those arms are described to have been
carried. Mr. Justice Blackstone lays down the right
of the subject to carry arms as
"having arms for their defence, suitable to their
condition and degree, and such as are allowed by
law. Which is also declared by the same statute 1
William and Mary, sess. 2. c.2; and it is indeed a
public allowance under due restrictions of the
natural right of resistance and self-preservation,
when the sanctions of society and laws are found
insufficient to restrain the violence of
oppression."(a)
Gentlemen, he refers to the Bill of Rights.
You will see what the Bill of Rights says upon that
subject. It provides that,
"The subjects which are Protestants may have arms
for their defence suitable to their conditions, and as
allowed by law."(b)
But are arms suitable to the condition of people
in the ordinary class of life, and are they allowed
by law? A man has a clear right to arms to protect
himself when he is going singly or in a small party
upon the road where he is travelling or going for
the ordinary purposes of business, But I have no
difficulty in saying you have no right to carry arms
to a public meeting, if the number of arms which
are so carried are calculated to produce terror and
alarm; and if you could be at liberty to carry arms
                                                                                                                                                                                            
102 op cit, p108. A memorandum by Mr Michael Yardley makes a similar claim for the 1689 provision: "The Bill
of Rights of 1689 confirmed a constitutional right to keep and bear arms .... The interesting point is that the right
to keep arms without impediment -- which was enshrined in common law until the late Victorian era -- is not a
Colonial invention" (p143). The last point is a reference to the "right to bear arms" provision of the Second
Amendment to the US Constitution 
103 601-2. See also, for example, R v Smith [1914] II IR 190, and cases cited therein
75


upon an expectation that by possibility there might
be an attack at the place, that would be an excuse
for carrying arms in every instance when you went
to a public meeting.(a) Therefore, I have no
difficulty in saying persons are not warranted in
carrying arms to a public meeting, if they are
calculated to create terror and alarm. You have no
right to suspect there will be an illegal attack on
you. Therefore, you are not at liberty to carry arms
with you.
Article 12
It has also been suggested that the Bill of Rights is relevant to any scheme of surrender of
firearms, including compensation arrangements, as in clauses 10 and 11 of the current bill.
The relevant provision which proponents of this argument may have in mind may be article
12:
"Grants of forfeitures -- That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of
particular persons before conviction are illegal and void."
Lock has described the historical context of this provision:104
This Article related to a system which worked as follows: if somebody was being tried for
treason (for example), it was the law that his possessions would be forfeit to the Crown if he
were convicted. Courtiers, or other well-placed individuals, would secure a promise from the
Crown that, in the event of a conviction, they would be given the traitor\'s property.
Halsbury\'s Laws sets out the general position of the right to property in English law:105
833. Right to property. The right not to be deprived of property without due
process of law(1) originated in Magna Carta(2) and has been restated and
amplified subsequently.(3) The right does not exclude expropriation for
public purposes such as by nationalisation or compulsory purchase order(4),
but an intention on the part of the legislature to deprive a person of his
property without compensation is not to be imputed unless it is stated in
express terms.(5) The right to property is protected by remedies in equity
and tort. The right includes a right to peaceful enjoyment of property(6),
which is similarly protected, but is subjected to compliance with legal
requirements as to user(7) and avoidance of injury to others and their
property.(8)
The right may be regarded as embracing the principle of no taxation
without representation(9); this principle, however, in view of the application

Many of the cases on the point relate to the taking of property by the state without agreement
or statutory authority, i.e. by use of purported prerogative power, and the \'right\' to
compensation in such circumstances.106 It would appear therefore that the validity of a
statutory scheme for the surrender of firearms and for payments to owners could not, under
general constitutional principles of Parliamentary sovereignty, be challenged on Bill of Rights
grounds. This is considered further below.
The \'constitutional\' status of the Bill of Rights 1689
While, in the unwritten/uncodified UK constitution, there are no unambiguously constitutional
\'higher\' laws as such107, statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689108 are generally regarded as
being \'core\' constitutional laws which deserve and receive particular respect and scrutiny by
the three branches of government. For example it is argued that legislators should take care
when passing laws which do or could conflict with such \'constitutional\' provisions, and the
courts will generally be unwilling to accept that the provisions of such legislation has been

In strict law there may be no difference in status... as between one Act of Parliament and
another, but I confess to some reluctance in holding that an Act of such constitutional
significance as the Union with Ireland Act is subject to the doctrine of implied repeal or of
obsolescence.
This has not prevented later express or implied repeal or amendment of supposed
\'untouchable\' constitutional statutory provisions, such as that in the Bill of Rights itself
concerning the succession to the throne, declared to be a provision which "shall stand remain
and be the law of this realm for ever..", which was altered a dozen years later by the Act of
Settlement 1700.
In the civil liberties context Feldman has related the provisions of the Bill of Rights to modern
circumstances:
Over time, others have benefited from the ethos of government produced by
Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights. However, to say that they offer
effective protection to rights ignores the reality of modern and perhaps pre-
modern, legislation and administration. The doctrine of parliamentary
supremacy, which Dicey advanced as a way of ensuring continuing
democratic accountability for legislation, left Parliament with the more or
less untrammelled power to restrict or abrogate rights and freedoms, as well
protect them. Magna Carta and the 1689 Bill of Rights can be repealed or
amended by implication by statutes, without even the need for express
words. Except in relation to the protection of property against unauthorized
taxation(94), the Bill of Rights has been restrictively interpreted, for example
denying a remedy to prisoners under the clause forbidding cruel and unusual
punishment unless the punishment could be shown to be both cruel and
unusual.(95)

95 Williams v. Home Office (No.2) [1981] 1 All ER 1211, below, ch. 6, s. 3(4)
Nevertheless the Bill of Rights remains an operative statute, as the history of the
Parliamentary privilege of free speech demonstrates.110 In Bowles v Bank of England [1913]
1 Ch 57 at 84-5, (no taxation other than by Act of Parliament, ie not by prerogative or
resolution of a House of Parliament), Parker J said that "the Bill of Rights still remains
unrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the
part of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its
provisions."111 Some of the articles are more \'loosely\' phrased than others, a factor in their

potential justiciability.112 Lock claimed that the set of articles " was in effect a programme
f o r f u t u r e
legislation":113
It was never intended that the Articles should stand on their own as substantive law but rather
that Parliament should return to these topics, elaborate on the summary texts and work them
up into full-scale statutes. This is made clear in the Commons Journal:
And towards the making a more firm and perfect Settlement of the said Religion, Laws and Liberties;
and for Remedy of several Defects and Inconveniences; it is proposed and advised by the said
Commons, that there be Provision, by new Laws, made in such manner, and with such Limitations,
as, by the wisdom and Justice of Parliament, shall be considered and ordained in the Particulars, and
to the Purposes, following...
At this point in the Journal a list is given of the headings to be covered by the programme.
The Declaration of Rights was drawn up in a hurry and was confined to topics on which the
Commons and Lords could agree. The original draft produced by the Commons\' Committee
included 28 heads but of these only 11 were included among the 13 appearing in the final
version. The remainder had to be sacrificed in the interests of speed and compromise. The
idea of dealing with new rights, as opposed to stating existing rights, had to go by the board
so that, for example, the granting of security of tenure to the higher judiciary had to be left
for a later occasion.
He believed that "whatever William\'s intentions may have been, [i.e. in the situation which
arose in 1689] the basic text of the Articles has been regarded as having statutory force, but
there can be a difficulty in the application to modern conditions of provisions enacted in very
brief terms three centuries ago."114
If the question of the application of the provision in the Bill of Rights to proposed or actual
measures of firearms control ever arose before the courts, doubtless the answer could hinge,
to some extent, on the construction of the qualifying phrases in article 7 "for their defence",
"suitable to their conditions" and "as allowed by law"; the applicability, if any, of the prima
facie religious discrimination provision in modern circumstances,115 and the historical-legal
context of the relevant legislation and caselaw, such as the existence, if at all, of some legal
\'right\' to possess firearms in light of the regulatory legislation of this century. 
                                                                                                                                                                                            
112 It may be noted that Wade & Bradley\'s standard constitutional law text cites every article -- "principal provisions
(known as \'articles\'), many of which are still in force as part of English law" -- except article 7: Constitutional
and administrative law, 11th ed (by Bradley and Ewing), 1993 , pp14-5. Lock lists article 7 as one of those
dealing with "issues that are no longer a problem", op cit, p560
113 Lock, op cit, pp541-2
114 p.542
115 For example, would it be regarded in the same light as the religious (dis)qualifications for the succession?

G. Northern Ireland
Firearm control in Northern Ireland is governed by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order
1981, as amended.116 A review of the legislation announced on 23.11.95 is in progress to take
account of developments in firearms technology and design and the growth in recreational and
sporting use of firearms in the consideration of legislation "largely unchanged since the
1960\'s".
Controls in Northern Ireland are broadly similar to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
On 1 November 1996, Sir John Wheeler announced a PQ on the law on hand guns in
Northern Ireland:117
Mr. Worthington: To ask the Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland if he will list the difference in
respect of guidelines relating to the legal possession
of handguns in (a) Northern Ireland and (b) Great
Britain.
Sir John Wheeler: Under the Firearms (Northern
Ireland) Order, 1981, the Chief Constable is
responsible for the administration of firearms
licensing. His policy in relation to sporting
handguns which was agreed with the Secretary of
State is that a person cannot acquire a handgun
unless he is able to show good reason for acquiring
such a firearm and he has been a member of a
registered firearms club for a minimum of 12
months; the application is supported by the
secretary of the firearms club; and the police are
content that he is a suitable person to hold such a
weapon. In addition, the Chief Constable may
approve the issue of a handgun where a person\'s
life is believed to be under a serious and specific
terrorist threat. In these circumstances the Chief
Constable must satisfy himself that the individual is
in all regards suitable to hold such a firearm and
that his possession of the firearm does not pose a
threat to the wider public safety.
The main difference is perhaps that the stricter controls in Great Britain over rifles, pistols
and short-barrelled shotguns etc. are applied in Northern Ireland to shotguns and air weapons.
In particular the onus is on the applicant to show that s/he has good reason to possess a
firearm, rather than on the police to show that s/he does not . The distinction has developed

Research Paper 96/103
8 November 1996
A landfill levy came into effect on 1 October 1996 as the UK\'s first ever environmental or
\'green\' tax. Landfill is by far the most common means of waste disposal in the UK, but the
Government\'s recent sustainable waste management strategy Making Waste Work undertook
to reduce the amount of waste being disposed of in this way. The Chancellor first announced
plans for a landfill levy in his 1994 Budget speech, though legislation to introduce the tax was
not brought forward until 1996, following a long consultation process. The tax is set at two
rates: £7 per tonne for active wastes and £2 per tonne for inert wastes. This paper outlines
the practice of landfilling waste, considers the justification for a tax and its likely effects, and
mentions landfill practices abroad.

I Summary
The UK has a long tradition of landfilling its waste, and over 90% of household waste goes
to landfill, with only 5% of household waste being recycled. For so-called \'controlled\' wastes,
the same figures are over 70% landfilled and 20% reused or recycled. Controls on landfill
practice are tighter today than in the past but environmental problems can still arise,
particularly in the generation of gas from landfill sites. In its sustainable development and
waste management strategies the Government has undertaken to swing the balance away from
landfill in favour of reuse, recycling and energy recovery from waste. The amount of waste
going to incineration, with energy recovery, is set to rise for various reasons, and energy from
landfill gas has also been included in the Non Fossil Fuel Obligations. The packaging waste
stream should start to decline as a result of the EU Packaging Directive which will soon be
implemented in the UK. 
On 1 October 1996 a new tax on waste disposal in landfill sites came into effect, following
a two year consultation process. The tax is levied per tonne of waste at two rates: £2 per
tonne for specified inactive wastes (such as glass); £7 per tonne for active wastes which are
capable of degrading (such as paper). Around 1,400 businesses will pay the tax, though
landfill site operators can mitigate its effects by contributing to an environmental trust. The
tax is expected to raise about £450 million per year, and the Government proposes to use
these receipts to help fund a cut in the main rate of National Insurance Contributions for
employers (from 10.2% to 10% from 6 April 1997).
The decision to impose a landfill tax and for this to be weight-based has been welcomed by
environmental organisations, although some have called for the levy to be set at a far higher
rate, and to cover all aspects of waste disposal, including incineration. Nevertheless, the
general view is that the advantages of landfill over incineration are set to decline anyway and
that while the levy will not have a significant effect on the amount of waste going to landfill
in the short term, it may in the longer term. Similarly, although even a higher levy would
probably do little to encourage recycling at present, again in the longer term this might
change. A system of environmental trusts has been established to fund research into
restoration of landfill sites, and clean-ups where liability is unclear. There have been fears
that the levy may cause an increase in the illegal dumping of waste, or fly-tipping, and also
that it may place burdens on local authority budgets; such issues are discussed in this paper. 
The UK is not alone in introducing a landfill levy, nor in relying heavily on landfill as a
disposal route. The EU\'s proposed Landfill Directive has just been rejected by the European
Parliament, and the Commission is about to table new proposals. In general, other Member
States favour tighter controls on landfill than the UK, and are seeking pretreatment of wastes
going to landfill, and restrictions on co-disposal sites (where different types of waste are
landfilled together). The UK\'s geology favours landfill to a greater extent than other countries,
and we have long experience of operating co-disposal sites; the Government has undertaken
to oppose any moves to require pretreatment for all wastes going to landfill.

Research Paper 96/103
II Landfill
A. Waste management strategy in the UK
1. The shifting scene
Landfill has long been the mainstay of British waste management practice and far outstrips
any other disposal method. For example, in the UK 90% of household waste is sent to
landfill, with only 5% of household waste being recycled and another 5% being incinerated.
The Government\'s recent sustainable waste management strategy Making Waste Work1
mentions that "landfill has served mankind for much longer than any alternative disposal
option." 
In the UK this is largely because our geology is more favourable towards landfill than that,
for instance, of other European countries. Generally, a clay rather than fissured or permeable
bedrock means that less money needs to be spent on engineering a landfill site, because there
is less danger of water carrying pollutants downwards or of liquid pollutants escaping and
seeping into water resources including valuable groundwaters or surface waters.2 So landfill
has been a cheap waste disposal option in the UK. Since waste disposal is carried out largely
by the private sector, such factors have favoured the continued use of landfill in the UK. Yet
in Making Waste Work3 the Government states that its primary waste management targets are
to:4
• reduce the proportion of controlled waste going to landfill from 70%
to 60% by 2005
• recover [includes incinerating] value from 40% of municipal waste by
2005
• set a target for the reduction of waste by the end of 1998.
This is because while over the years the engineering standards of landfill practice have
increased markedly it can still be argued that the full environmental costs of landfilling waste
are not reflected in the relatively cheap price of landfill as a disposal option. In the first of

authorities have been set a target of recycling 25% of household waste by the year 2000.

Research Paper 96/103
its This Common Inheritance series of White Papers on the environment, the Government
undertook to apply the \'precautionary principle\' to environmental policy:5
"Where there are significant risks of damage to the environment, the Government will
be prepared to take precautionary action to limit the use of potentially dangerous
materials, or the spread of potentially dangerous pollutants, even where scientific
knowledge is not conclusive, if the balance of likely costs and benefits justifies it."
The discrepancy between the environmental costs and the price of landfill becomes more
marked when the principles of sustainable development are applied. Sustainable development
entails conserving scarce resources, and minimising damage to the environment6. Void space
for landfill is a finite resource, and while technical standards of landfill sites have improved,
there is still always the possibility of environmental damage occurring (see page 11 onwards).
The Government Panel on Sustainable Development in its second report7 continued to
advocate a move towards the use of taxes on resources including energy rather than labour
and income, and welcomed the (then proposed) landfill tax. In its 1994 sustainable
development strategy produced in the wake of the Rio Earth Summit the Government
highlighted the unsustainability of current waste management practices:8
"Large quantities of waste arise as an undesirable by-product of modern production,
packaging and consumption, with threats to soil, air and water quality if the waste is
not properly managed. The aim must be to minimise the amount of waste produced
and to make best use of the waste which is produced. In this way, loss of valuable
raw materials and the land which is required for disposal can both be minimised. 
...There is a hierarchy of waste management options:
• REDUCTION
• REUSE
• RECOVERY (INCLUDING RECYCLING AND
ENERGY RECOVERY)
• DISPOSAL WITHOUT ENERGY RECOVERY BY

Research Paper 96/103
In 1993 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) published its seventeenth
report - Incineration of Waste9 - which called for an increase in incineration, noting that the
"emissions from a well operated incineration plant complying with the new HMIP10 standards
are most unlikely to cause any health effects." The RCEP lamented the UK\'s reliance on
landfill, particularly because of its contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. Energy from
waste has now been included in the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligations (see page 15) but bands
include both incineration and the use of landfill gas so it is difficult to tell how this will affect
the balance between the two practices. 
Finally, it is worth noting that the packaging waste stream should start to decline as a result
of EC Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, which should have been
implemented in Member States by 30 June 1996. By 30 June 2001, 50-65% by weight of
packaging waste will have to be recovered (recovery includes incineration for energy) and 25-
45% will have to be recycled, with at least 15% by weight of each packaging material being
recycled. In the UK, a comprehensive consultation with industry has resulted in the decision
to apply a shared legal obligation to all large businesses (which manufacture, fill, sell or
supply packaging, and which use over 50 tonnes of packaging a year) no matter where they
lie in the packaging chain. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste)
Regulations: A Consultation Paper11 was open for consultation until 9 September; the
environmental agencies will police the scheme, and final implementing Regulations should
be laid in November 1996. 
2. The UK waste management regime
The UK\'s waste management system operates under Part II of the Environmental Protection
Act 1990 (EPA) as amended by the Environment Act 1995. The EPA had strengthened and
largely superseded the waste management licensing system which had been operating under
the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (CoPA) and introduced the concept of \'duty of care\' of
waste, prohibiting its unauthorised or harmful deposit, treatment or disposal. 
Anyone in control of waste must prevent the escape of the waste from their control, and must
pass the waste on only to an authorised person. In addition, anyone wishing to operate
disposal, storage or treatment facilities for controlled waste, whether or not destined for
recycling or disposal, requires a waste disposal or management licence from a waste disposal
or regulation authority, although exempted activities exist. Breaching any conditions attached
to such a licence is an offence. Under the EPA, the waste regulation authorities (WRAs)
were generally the local authorities, who were thereby able to ensure that waste disposal

companies disposed of waste properly. The waste disposal companies were either private
firms to whom work was contracted out (particularly in the industrial and commercial waste
fields) or were local authority waste disposal companies set up at arms length. 
The Environment Act 1995 transferred waste regulation powers to the newly created
environment agencies12 which are intended to provide a \'one stop shop\' approach to
environmental protection and regulation and incorporate the former National Rivers Authority
(NRA) and HMIP, plus the waste regulation powers of local authorities. This should provide
a national integrated approach to pollution control. For example, consider a landfill site
operating in England. The NRA, which used to grant consents to discharge pollution into
water courses, would have set licence conditions to prevent water carrying away contaminants
from the landfill site. As well as this, the local authority, acting as the waste regulation
authority, would have issued a waste management licence for the site to be operated. The
waste regulation authority could also impose licence conditions to prevent landfill sites from
causing serious problems. Under the 1995 Act the environment agencies will issue
environmental licences which will cover all environmental aspects of running a landfill site.
Of course the duty of care concept means that the illegal dumping of waste, or fly-tipping,
is an offence, and if any waste is deposited on land in contravention of the duty of care
provisions, the environment agencies may take steps necessary to remove or reduce the effect
of the waste, if this is necessary to prevent pollution or damage to health. In addition, the
Control of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989 and Regulations made under it allow the
regulatory authorities (now the environment agencies) to stop and investigate a vehicle
carrying waste, if they have reasonable grounds to believe that it has been used for the illegal
disposal of waste. 
3. Wastes arising and disposal routes
 
\'Controlled waste\' (the term arises because the waste is in effect \'controlled\' by the provisions
of the 1990 EPA and duty of care) includes household, industrial and commercial waste,
sewage sludge and dredged spoils. The main exemptions from the definition of controlled
waste are agricultural, mine and quarry wastes, and most radioactive waste13. 
Controlled waste also includes \'special waste\', which is the most dangerous controlled waste
and thus subject to extra controls. These now include the need for prior notification to the

Environmental Agency of all consignments, which are then registered on a national database.
The mixing of different categories of special waste, and of special and non-special wastes is
prohibited. \'Special waste\' is defined by Regulations which implemented EC Directive 91/689
on hazardous waste, and household waste is exempted from being special waste14. 
Data on the amount of wastes produced and their management are scarce in the UK, as in
much of the rest of Europe. The sole regular source of waste data for England and Wales is
the annual survey of former waste disposal authorities undertaken by the Chartered Institute
of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). In recent years, however, the response rates
from authorities have been so low that its figures cannot be used to produce national
estimates15.
The Department of the Environment has published details of its proposals for improving the
quality of waste management data in future years16, but for the moment is reliant on data
estimated from a number of surveys undertaken in 1990 and in the latter part of the 1980s.
These surveys suggest that over 400 million tonnes of waste are produced in the UK each
year, of which around 250 million tonnes is controlled waste. 
Table 1 (overleaf) summarises the DoE\'s estimates of wastes arising and their disposal routes.
These figures suggest that, in 1990, some 125 million tonnes of controlled waste went to
landfill in the UK. Around 90% of household waste and 72% of all controlled waste goes
to landfill. Only 5% of household waste and 20% of all controlled waste is recycled or re-
used.
Evidence from Scotland, where reliable surveys of local authority waste management are
carried out annually, suggests that the predominance of landfilling has not declined
significantly since 1990. In 1990, Scottish local authorities disposed of around 9.7 million
tonnes of controlled waste to landfill, which represented 95% of total controlled waste
retained for disposal. In 1992, they landfilled some 12.2 million tonnes, around 90% of the
total.17
Somewhat more reliable figures are available on the generation and disposal of special wastes,
principally because the regulation of such waste has required waste regulation authorities
(now the environment agencies), to monitor its movement. In 1993/94, special waste arisings

in the UK totalled slightly over 2 million tonnes. Of the 1.9 million tonnes retained for
disposal by WRAs in England and Wales, slightly less than half, 0.9 million tonnes, went to
co-disposal (see page 17) landfill sites. A further 0.6 million tonnes were physically or
chemically treated, processes which can take waste outside of the definition of special waste.
 Some of this treated waste will also have been sent to landfill18.

B. Landfill sites
In Making Waste Work19 the Government listed the advantages of landfill. It is inexpensive;
suitable for a wide range of wastes; there is a large capacity remaining in some areas; landfill
gas is a clean source of fuel for heat and power generation; restored land provides valuable
space for wildlife and leisure activities; and well designed landfills can be unobtrusive.
However, it noted that all landfills need careful management to ensure that their potential for

pollution is minimised, and pointed out the potential disadvantages of landfill:
• versatility and convenience of landfill make it less attractive for waste
producers to be innovative in the way in which they deal with their
wastes
• however well engineered, there is a finite risk of contamination from
operational landfill sites;
• landfill gas can pose significant risks including release of methane,
an important greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere;
• after landfilling, the land may retain some contamination and so be
unsuitable for some uses;
• noise, odour and unsightliness, and vehicle movements, may cause
nuisance, in common with all waste disposal and recovery activities,
and;
• energy recovery from landfill is less efficient than some other
disposal options such as incineration.
1. Landfill gas
According to 1991 DoE guidance:20
"An increasing number of incidents and growing public concern have focused
attention on the fate of the end-products of waste degradation in landfill sites and their
effects on the environment. One major area of concern is the evolution of landfill gas
which, when inadequately controlled, has led to explosions, fires, dangerous gas
concentrations in and around houses, odour nuisance and vegetation dieback." 
Landfill gas arises through the breakdown of biodegradable wastes inside a landfill.
Biodegradable wastes include paper, wood and animal and vegetable matter, and as microbes
break these materials down, usually in conditions of little oxygen, they produce a mixture of
gases comprising mostly carbon dioxide (around 35%) and methane (around 65%). The gas
given off, or evolved, through microbial activity may mix with other gases in the landfill,
perhaps giving rise to odours. It also comes out of the site moist and warm21 so it needs to
be treated before it can be burnt, for instance, and it is more likely to act as a corrosive. It

can travel through and away from the site along pathways such as sewers, cavities or natural
fissures if these exist, or it may dissolve into leachates (liquids that have seeped through a
landfill extracting substances from the wastes en route) or groundwater and be transported in
that way. If not properly managed, landfill gas can give rise to flammability, toxicity and
asphyxiation hazards, and bare patches, brown foliage and dieback in vegetation. 
It may take from 3 months to a year before methane is evolved in significant amounts from
a site, and the process may continue for well over 15 years22, or even for \'many decades\' after
filling with wastes has finished23. 
Methane (CH4) is one of gases which has contributed most to the enhanced greenhouse effect
which may be leading to global warming24. The amounts of methane in the atmosphere have
been increasing since the start of the 19th century and current levels are the highest ever
observed, including records from ice cores which go back 160,000 years. While the rate of
increase in the 1980s was lower than that of the 1970s, atmospheric methane is still
increasing. It is estimated that, globally, 20-40% of current methane emissions come from
natural sources (including the digestive systems of animals, rotting vegetation, anaerobic bogs
and so on), 20% from fossil fuel related sources (such as the burning of coal and leakage
from gas mains), and 40-60% from other man-made sources, including landfill25. 
In the UK landfill is the single greatest source of methane, with around 46% of the UK\'s total
emissions probably coming from landfill in 1994. The next largest contributions came from
cattle at 21%; other sources (such as deep-mined coal, gas leakage and sheep) contributed
under 10% each26. In its report on the Incineration of Waste the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution noted:27
"Nearly all of [the UK\'s municipal waste] goes to landfill where it produces both
carbon dioxide and methane and contributes substantially to the greenhouse effect.
Methane has a particularly strong effect ... by incinerating municipal waste rather than
landfilling it a significant and worthwhile contribution could be made to reducing
emissions of greenhouse gases."

Research Paper 96/103
The estimates for the contribution of landfill to methane emissions are uncertain because it
is difficult to know how much waste has been landfilled in the past and precisely how much
is being landfilled now (see page 37). The rate of methane production will also depend on
the composition, density and input rate of the landfilled waste, the moisture, temperature and
acidity/alkalinity of the site, and the site\'s physical characteristics, which will affect the ease
with which the gas can escape. 
Of course the amount of methane evolved from a site will also depend on the control
measures in place or the amount being harnessed. A particular problem in the past has been
old sites, often closed local authority landfills, which had been neither designed nor operated
with gas control in mind. In 1987 HMIP wrote to all waste disposal authorities drawing to
their attention the need to ensure that all landfill licences contained appropriate conditions for
landfill gas management, and a 1991 report from HMIP estimated that just over 1,000 sites
(both active and closed, and private and local authority run) might need gas controls
installed28. Following the 1990 EPA, the DoE issued guidance stating that all sites should be
considered as having the potential to generate landfill gas, and that:29 
"No [landfill] licence should be issued until the [waste regulation authority] is
satisfied with the gas monitoring, and where necessary, gas control arrangements, as
detailed in the working plan." 
Monitoring measures comprise boreholes sunk around the perimeter of the site which can be
used to check the performance of the gas extraction system and to ensure that gas is not
migrating sideways and out; they will end in a small cap or box above ground, and can be
checked using either installed or portable dataloggers30. Control measures may involve the
use of barriers with vent trenches or pipes used in conjunction with an active pumping system
when passive venting is inadequate. When a gas is not combustible it can be directly vented
to the atmosphere, or else support fuel can be added to burn it in a flarestack; this reduces
associated odour problems31. Gas flaring also reduces the amount of methane emitted to the
atmosphere, by converting it to carbon dioxide, a less powerful greenhouse gas32. 
Rather than simply venting or flaring off landfill gas, it can be harnessed for energy. One
step up the waste hierarchy from disposal is recovery, and energy recovery from waste
projects are provided specifically for in the Non Fossil Fuel Obligations (NFFO). NFFO
Orders require electricity companies to buy electricity at a premium rate from designated
producers who are not using fossil fuels; while they were originally aimed at nuclear power

they now cover renewables. The Government\'s view is that33:
"The utilisation of the energy potential of waste materials is also an important part of
the Government\'s recycling initiative and will assist in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. Future waste disposal strategies are likely to lead to increased incineration
and energy recovery from municipal, industrial and other waste."

projects and 284 waste fired projects, of which 89 are combined heat and power schemes and
195 waste by fluidised bed combustion schemes. Prospective new landfill gas generating
stations have to be from licensed sites where tipping was being carried out prior to 22 July
199335. 
Friends of the Earth have said that "only in a tiny fraction of possible cases is [landfill] gas
collected and used for fuel,"36 although this statement was based on the results of a 1989
survey. In the UK in 1994 around 163,000 tonnes of methane from landfills was being used
to generate electricity37 and this was well over twice the amount harnessed in 199038.
Nevertheless, an estimated 1,790,000 tonnes of methane in total was emitted from landfills
in 199439. The government has set a target of 300MW of electricity being generated from
landfill gas by the year 2000, which is one fifth of its overall target from renewable sources,
and would mean using 520,000 tonnes of methane each year40. 
Generally, electricity generation plants are situated at the landfill site, and the generation
equipment, such as large spark ignition engines or gas turbines, are integrated with the gas
extraction plant. Alternatively the gas can be pumped to a nearby end user, to provide heat
in industrial processes such as firing and drying in brick and cement manufacturers, or raising
steam for the drying and bleaching of textiles or paper, heating commercial greenhouses or
food processing. Flarestacks are still needed to regulate the gas at a site whether or not
energy is extracted, and the gas may need a range of pre-treatments, particularly de-watering,
before it can be used as a fuel41. 
However, Friends of the Earth make the point that being able to make use of some landfill
gas is not a justification for continuing the practice of extensive landfill and their views
reflect the waste hierarchy:42
"Landfilling waste is associated with a wide range of environmental problems. Using
landfill gas to generate energy only recovers a small fraction of the energy that is lost
when the waste is landfilled- far greater energy savings are made if the waste is not
produced in the first place or if it is reused or recycled. Therefore the use of landfill
gas as an energy source should not been seen as a justification for the continuing
landfilling of the vast majority of our waste."

2. Co-disposal sites and inert material
While landfill gas arises through biological degradation of waste, leachates form through both
biological and purely chemical reactions. Landfilled waste releases inorganic and organic
materials, and also as reactions take place the products may become dissolved into solution.
With regard to co-disposal sites and sites accepting special waste, the DoE note that43:
"Although most landfills are chemical reactors, the reactions are particularly
significant at a special waste or co-disposal landfill"
When the waste regulation authority/environment agency licence a landfill site, the DoE suggests44
that it may be useful to classify the site in two ways: firstly according to the types of waste it will
accept, and secondly by the extent to which it is designed to contain pollutants; this will help
decide how complex and difficult the proposed site will be to operate.
A suggested scheme is, according to waste accepted;
Sites which accept inert waste only
Sites which accept industrial waste that does not consist of and does not include
special waste
Sites which accept other non-inert controlled waste that does not consist of and does
not include special waste; a combination of a special waste and some other controlled
waste if they can be disposed of together
Sites which accept special waste only
And according to the principles of operation and containment;
Sites which include containment sites which are designed to allow no significant
release of leachate, or migration of landfill gas
Sites that need few such measures, because the waste types/environmental setting pose
no significant threat to the environment
While many sites were licensed under CoPA 1974 to accept \'inert\' wastes, the definition used
at that time was not adequate, because it included materials that in fact degraded very slowly,

such as wood from demolition sites. The practice of setting arbitrary limits to allow some
small contamination of non-inert waste such as 5 or 10% for paper and cardboard was also
considered ineffective and unenforceable by 1994; only genuinely inert waste should be
permitted at sites licensed for inert waste. The DoE recommended that licence conditions
specify acceptable wastes such as soil, sand, clay, stone, concrete, bricks, slate, glass and
ceramics45. 
In stark contrast to the complex reactions that may take place in a co-disposal site or a site
accepting special wastes, "landfill sites taking truly inert material will not produce significant
concentrations of pollutants. No important chemical or biological processes will take place
in the site."46 It is unlikely that landfill gas or leachates will ever be generated in a truly inert
site which has never taken non-inert wastes, so the costs of running the site, of post-closure
remediation and possible costs to the environment will be far lower.
At special waste or co-disposal sites, extra measures are needed. For instance, the location
of any special waste deposit should be notified to the Environment Agency, and on-site
laboratory facilities may be needed for the analysis of waste accepted. 
The acceptance of unauthorised waste at a landfill is an offence. For example, a waste
producer, carrier and landfill operator were recently fined £8000 plus costs following a
prosecution brought by the Environment Agency after a consignment of special waste was
brought to a site and deposited, although it was later found to contain wastes not permitted
by the site licence. The case was brought under CoPA 1974 and the EPA 1990 and came
to light when a drum containing hydrochloric acid burst open during tipping; hydrofluoric
acid was also included in the consignment. An Environment Agency spokesman stressed that
similar cases involving breaches of the duty of care and legislation designed to protect the
environment would be prosecuted by the Agency, and commented that \'It is vital that only
waste permitted by the site licence is accepted by landfill operators\'.47,48 
Similarly, the Environment Agency has successfully prosecuted a Cambridgeshire landfill
operator who held a landfill licence for chalk, soil and subsoil but had accepted concrete,
asphalt, wood and green plastic piping. The operator was fined £10,000 plus costs49. 
In one of the series of Industry Profiles sponsored by its Contaminated Land and Liabilities
Division, the DoE describes briefly the poor landfill practices which existed before regulation

and the increased awareness of the potential hazards of landfill50:
"Landfill sites were originally small informal and uncontrolled tips used by local
authorities or industry for the disposal of waste to land ... Prior to the 1970s the
majority had little or no engineering control of wastes beyond that provided by the
local topography and geology."
In 1994 a company called UK Waste, which had been auditing 158 landfill sites with a view
to acquiring these, released the results of its survey which showed, it said, poor engineering
standards at many sites. While UK Waste reportedly has a policy of operating only
containment sites with at least a single containment liner, plus leachate and gas management
and monitoring systems, it found that of all sites surveyed (68 of which were closed and 90
operational) 54% had no leachate collection systems and half had no gas control systems.
Of the operational sites, 22% were on in situ clay, 17% had a single liner and 12% composite
liners; the rest, around half, had no liners but were so called \'dilute and disperse\' sites. UK
Waste alleged that this meant its costs for landfilling were in the mid-teens per tonne while
other operators could undercut them at £5-10 per tonne. The company criticised the practice
of allowing old landfill sites to continue operating \'indefinitely until they were full\', and also
called on the DoE to make it clear that co-disposal should not be carried out in anything but
engineered containment sites.51 
3. Completion and restoration 
A landfill licence cannot be surrendered unless the Environment Agency accepts this
surrender; the Agency must inspect the land and be satisfied that the site is unlikely to cause
pollution of the environment or harm to human health (and thereby meets the so-called
\'completion condition\' under the 1990 EPA). It can then issue a \'completion certificate\'. 
To check whether a site meets the \'completion condition\' the quantity and quality of leachate
present, the flow and concentration of gas, the future potential for leachate and gas to be
formed, any physical instability and the presence of particular problem wastes all need to be
considered. Each site needs a case by case assessment. 
Restoration is the process through which a landfill site is returned to a condition suitable for
after-use. Draft Waste Management Paper (WMP) 26E on Landfill restoration and post
closure management52 has just been issued and the consultation period ends on 18 November

199653. The Environment Agency emphasises the need for a holistic approach
to landfill, to integrate the process "from initial concept to final capping, restoration and
aftercare." 
Several after-use options exist and include agriculture, woodland, amenity or nature
conservation, or \'hard end\' uses (such as a car park). In the past agricultural uses (particularly
as pasture) have been the most common after-use for landfill sites, but this could be attributed
to the importance attached to agricultural production and concerns about the feasibility of
other uses; for example, planting trees on a capped site has in the past been discouraged, but
this advice is now being reviewed. 
Problems in the past have often resulted from a lack or loss of suitable restoration materials
in the form of suitable topsoils, the availability of which are critical in the choice of afteruse
(although on-site soil substitutes such as dredgings, sediment, spoils or waste limestone may
be used as subsoils to reduce the amount of soil that needs to be imported to a site). The
type of waste which a site has accepted is another important influence in the choice of
afteruse; a site that has taken largely inert wastes will be suitable for a range of afteruses
including hard development. Conversely a site containing biodegradable wastes, particularly
a deep site, will probably not be suitable for a hard end use because it will experience
problems of unstable and contaminated ground and of landfill gas generation. 
The pollution control systems needed on a closed landfill may include a capping layer,
leachate and landfill gas systems, and monitoring points for settlement, groundwater quality,
leachate and gas. While many old landfills are not capped, and inert sites may not need a
capping system, where one is used it may be constructed of clay, a synthetic material, a
purpose-designed geotextile or a combination of these. Detailed advice is given by the
Environment Agency in draft WMP 26E as to the design of capping and gas and leachate
systems. 
4. Planning and other controls
As well as the usual planning system which operates through the Town and Country Planning
Act 1990 in England and Wales and through the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act
1972 as amended, landfills are subject to extra controls. The Government\'s planning policy
guidance notes, particularly PPG 2354, give advice on how the planning system relates to
landfill sites, and the Environment Agency\'s draft Waste Management Paper 26E55 gives a

useful summary of the planning framework. 
The Planning and Compensation Act 1991 allows local authorities to impose five year
\'aftercare periods\' to follow the completion of any restoration conditions at any site where
refuse or waste has been deposited. Under the 1990 EPA landfill licences may also have
conditions attached relating to aftercare (ie, to the period after landfill operations have
finished). In addition, the waste regulation authority often requires a restoration plan to be
submitted with the application for a waste management licence. Applicants must show that
they have arranged funding for long term obligations, such as monitoring water and landfill
gas56. 
The Environment Agency is thought to be currently reviewing its policy regarding the
provision of financial guarantees for landfill sites. There has been speculation that it favours
the use of escrow accounts (an independent fund into which the operator pays a fixed sum
per tonne of waste landfilled). The money is not tax deductible until spent and is not under
the operator\'s control. The Environmental Services Association, the trade association which
represents much of the waste disposal industry, has commented that \'Locking away millions
of pounds at low interest won\'t help anyone\' and favours companies being able to simply
make provision in their accounts. Several companies have called on the Agency not to make
escrow accounts a normal condition of a landfill licence, and to reduce the sums involved57.
Directive 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment58 requires Member States to
ensure that projects likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of their
nature, size or location are subject to environmental assessment (EA). The assessment can
then be used by the planning authority when deciding whether to grant planning permission.
EA is required for projects listed in two Annexes to the Directive, roughly equivalent to the
Schedules of the UK implementing regulations. Landfill sites for special waste will always
require EA and other landfill sites probably will if they have a capacity of over 75,000 tonnes
a year59. (The Directive is presently being tightened.) Sites accepting inert waste only are
unlikely to need EA60. The developer has to submit a plan along with the planning
application describing the site\'s nature and size, to let the local planning authority decide
whether the development is likely to require full EA.

Research Paper 96/103
III Landfill tax 
A. First proposals for a tax on waste
The idea that new taxes can be used to tackle environmental problems was given serious
consideration in the White Paper This Common Inheritance - a review of all aspects of UK
environmental policy published in 1990. "Taxes can be the most effective means of tackling
environmental problems, and so merit serious examination", it was suggested, though this
statement was qualified by the observation that, "their use raises wider economic, social and
industrial consequences which need to be weighed in the balance."61 Nonetheless, the White
Paper made a strong case that governments could not rely solely on regulation in any
effective environmental strategy:62
1.25 If Governments want to stop something happening, or make something happen
in a different way, they have broadly two choices: they can by law lay down rules
and regulations on standards to be met or equipment to be installed; or they can use
the market to influence the behaviour of producers and their customers. Whichever
course they choose, the objective is to make those who cause environmental damage
face the costs of control in full, without subsidy. That is called the "polluter pays"
principle which the Government, in common with many other Governments, adopts.
If we impose higher standards centrally, this puts extra costs on producers and on
their customers in turn; if we use price signals, for example by imposing charges or
taxes on certain activities, extra costs again fall on the manufacturers, and then on
their customers. This "polluter pays" principle is an important means of influencing
potential polluters.
1.26 In the past, governments in Britain and elsewhere have mostly used regulation
to control pollution. "Fog everywhere", wrote Dickens about Victorian London.
Eventually, the British Government used the law to impose regulations to clean up
London\'s air. And there are large numbers of laws and regulations to protect the
quality of our water and air and to control disposal of wastes on land. This regulatory
approach has served Britain and other countries well, and it will remain an important
part of future environmental controls. For example, our new system of integrated
pollution control will regulate industrial processes of all types to ensure the best
outcome for the environment as a whole.
1.27 Regulation, however, does have limitations. It can be expensive to monitor and
difficult to up-date quickly in response to scientific and technical advance. It cannot
always pitch controls at the level which strikes the most cost-effective balance
between environmental benefits and compliance costs. Compliance costs can fall
widely - on business, on Government, and on consumers - and are easy to
underestimate in advance. And so long as it remains the responsibility of the

Research Paper 96/103
regulator, usually central Government, to lay down the ways in which pollution targets
should be met, there will always be the danger that insufficiently flexible systems will
be created and some better options overlooked. In short, regulation has always been
required and is still required, but it has its shortcomings.
1.28 For these reasons the Government, along with other Governments throughout the
world, has begun to look for ways to control pollution which avoid some of these
problems by working with the grain of the market. The ideas include various forms
of pollution charges, as well as taxes and other economic instruments, all designed to
encourage consumers and producers to behave in ways which benefit the environment
...
1.29 These new approaches have been described loosely as the market-based approach
to the environment, since they involve integrating economic and environmental
concerns and applying market economics more broadly. In the Government\'s view,
market mechanisms offer the prospect of a more efficient and flexible response to
environmental issues, both old and new.
Indeed, the "polluter pays" principle - that the cost of preventing pollution or minimising
environmental damage due to pollution should be borne by those responsible for the pollution
- is one of the foundations of the EC\'s environmental policy.63 Though the White Paper
argued that those responsible for waste discharges should pay for the social cost of disposing
of that waste, it did not propose a landfill levy, instead referring to recycling credits and to
market forces pushing the costs of disposal generally:64
The Government\'s policy is to harness market forces more effectively to encourage
waste minimisation. The Environmental Protection Bill establishes a strict
environmental regime for the disposal of waste, whether it is burned (incineration) or
put in the ground (landfill). One effect of this will be to make waste disposal much
more expensive. Increasing disposal costs will in turn provide a strong incentive for
industry to cut down the volume of waste it produces and to make more use of
cleaner technologies.
In 1993 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution published a report - Incineration
of Waste65 - which made the case that the methods of waste disposal posed a serious
environmental problem, in part because the pricing of different methods did not accurately
reflect their true costs. The report included an analysis by Aspinwall & Co of the relative
costs of waste disposal by landfill and incineration. The Commission pointed out that both

Research Paper 96/103
this report, and a second one on landfill costs produced by Coopers & Lybrand66, excluded
the environmental costs associated with incineration and landfill:67
These environmental costs do not have to be met by the operators of a waste disposal
facility, and in consequence are unlikely to be taken into account in their investment
and operational decisions. In other words, the private costs to the operator are not
likely to reflect fully the overall cost of waste disposal to the community. If disposal
charges are as a result lower than the full economic costs of disposal (including the
environmental costs), the quantities of waste sent for disposal may be larger, and the
proportion recycled smaller, than would be the case if the charges reflected the full
economic costs. Moreover the methods of disposal chosen may not correspond with
the best practicable environmental option.
For its part, the Coopers & Lybrand report on a landfill levy68 estimated that the costs of
landfill could rise by between 37 and 135% by the year 2000 in some scenarios (eg, inner
cities where land is expensive), approaching or exceeding the cost of incineration even
without a levy. Even so, it went on to conclude that if a levy were to be introduced its
primary effect would be an increase in the amount of waste being incinerated, especially in
high landfill cost urban areas, where incineration was expected to become progressively more
attractive than landfill.
The Royal Commission noted pretreatment of landfill waste by incineration could reduce the
long term risks from pollution, the production of greenhouse gases, and the incidence of
leaching from landfill sites (since incinerated waste in the form of slag and ash is biologically
inactive by comparison with raw municipal waste), as well as cut the volume of waste
deposited in landfill by up to 90%. However, those using landfill sites had to see incineration
as financially desirable, something that the current pricing structure could not deliver. As a
consequence, the Commission recommended that a levy be applied to all waste deposited in
landfill sites:69
We are convinced that a levy on waste disposal is justifiable in order to reflect the
cost to the community of the environmental effects of waste disposal and the benefit
from the reduced use of raw materials and energy made possible by recycling. We
would expect the cost of a levy to be passed on in charges to waste disposal
authorities, and in turn passed on by them to households through higher council tax
payments and to firms through charges for the disposal of commercial waste. Both
households and (more directly) firms would then have an incentive to produce less
waste and recycle waste materials, so reducing levels of pollution.

One other reason for a levy, mentioned in the Coopers and Lybrand report, was that it could
provide a clean up fund for managing later environmental difficulties which might arise.
Environmental Trusts were first mentioned in a consultation paper - issued by Customs &
Excise in March 1995:70 non-profit making distributing bodies, in the private sector, making
grants to restore closed landfill sites, and financing research into more sustainable waste
management practices. Their introduction is discussed in detail in section IV C of this paper.
B. Government consultation on the tax
1. Basis of the tax
When he first proposed a new tax on landfill in his 1994 Budget speech, the Chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, argued that the tax would achieve the twin objectives of raising money and
protecting the environment, without adding to the burdens of business:71
Taxes can play an important role in protecting the environment. One major
problem is the disposal of waste. I would like to make an announcement
today to help tackle the problem. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for the Environment and I will issue shortly a consultation paper
setting out details of a new tax to be collected by Customs and Excise on
waste disposed in landfill. We propose that a new landfill tax should come
into effect in 1996. It should raise several hundred million pounds a year.
But I am determined not to impose additional costs on business overall. I
shall therefore be looking at ways to offset the impact of the new tax by
making further compensatory reductions in the level of employer national
insurance contributions when the new tax is introduced. In brief, I want to
raise tax on polluters to make further cuts in the tax on jobs.
The consultation paper issued in March 1995 proposed an ad valorem basis for the tax, with
the aim of striking "the best balance between environmental justification and practical
feasibility."72 An ad valorem tax was preferred to a specific duty charged by reference to
weight or volume of waste disposed. It was argued that this provided "a straightforward
proxy for the environmental impacts of landfill disposal", and that an ad valorem tax would
have lower compliance costs and would be easier to police than other possible taxes.

gather views on the design of the tax, following the Chancellor\'s announcement the previous November.

Research Paper 96/103
A number of respondents argued that the practical effects of an ad valorem tax might well
conflict with the environmental objectives of the Government had in introducing it, in
particular by encouraging those disposing of waste to use the cheapest sites, sites which most
likely have lower environmental standards, and transporting their waste longer distances by
road to reach these sites. In addition, it was thought an ad valorem charge would result in
more illegal tipping of waste ("fly-tipping"; see below), and hit those local authorities in areas
where land was relatively scarce for landfill sites. As a consequence in August the
Chancellor announced that landfill tax would be weight-based, charged per tonne of waste,
and that inert waste would be subject to a reduced rate of tax.73 The announcement was
generally welcomed, notably by the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors.74
2. Local authorities
An important characteristic of the tax is that it is to be charged on all those who use landfill
- local authorities just as much as private companies. Indeed, in the consultation process that
has followed the 1994 Budget announcement, the Government has consistently emphasised
that for the tax to achieve its purpose, it would have to affect the behaviour of all those who
use landfill sites. For example, in a long written answer in March 1996 the then Paymaster
General, David Heathcoat-Amory noted the following:75
"The underlying purpose of the tax is to make environmental costs [of waste
disposal] explicit and ensure that those contemplating activities with
environmental impacts take account of those costs. The tax will also
provide an incentive for waste producers to look for new ways to reduce the
amount of waste they produce."
In the March 1995 consultation paper, the impact of the new charge on local authorities was
discussed:76
Local authorities are responsible for the collection and disposal of household wastes,
and the cost of tax in respect of such wastes would fall on them ... [the Government

Research Paper 96/103
In September 1995 HM Customs & Excise published a report on the responses it had received
to the consultation paper. One issue raised by correspondents had been the impact of the new
tax on local authorities:77
6. Effect  of  the  tax  on  local  authorities
As indicated above, local authorities were particularly active in expressing their views
and concerns, which included:
• fly-tipping - cost of policing and removal;
• cost of the tax and how it will be met, including the gap between the tax burden and
benefit of employers\' national insurance contributions (NICS) reductions, although
there was a great deal of uncertainty about the net financial impact;
• whether local authorities will be able to pass on the cost of the tax to householders
via the Council Tax; and
• the lack of incentive that the tax offers to those ultimately producing waste to
change their behaviour, particularly householders.
The Government\'s response was included in Customs\' report:78
The Government recognises taxes will never be universally popular but welcomes the
support received for the tax which it believes will help curb damage to the
environment. This will be introduced as planned on 1 October 1996 ...
The concerns of local authorities are also understood by the Government. Local
authorities are responsible for the collection and disposal of household waste, and it
is recognised that the cost of the tax in respect of such waste that is landfilled will fall
on them. The proposed reductions in employers\' NICs will affect local authorities
and, over the coming months, the Government will address the issue of the financial
impact of the tax on local authorities in the context of the local government finance
settlement.
When the tax was debated on the floor of the House in January 1996, David Heathcoat-
Amory emphasised that some businesses and some local authorities would see an increase in
their costs as a consequence of this new impost:79
"There are bound to be winners and losers. Not all businesses or types of
business will unequivocally be winners because they will incur landfill tax
charges that are greater than any benefit that they receive in national
insurance contributions. That is true for local authorities as a whole."

Research Paper 96/103
Some have argued that the "losers" from a landfill levy will include council taxpayers. The
Scottish Local Government Information Unit, funded by Scottish local authorities and trade
unions, has claimed the tax will probably not increase recycling rates in the near future,
because the cost of setting up recycling operations to reduce the amounts of landfill tax paid
will "require additional resources which local authorities, in the light of the last budget
settlement, will be unable to meet."80 Indeed, the 1993 Coopers & Lybrand study on a
landfill levy estimated that in the short term a landfill tax of £10 per tonne would lead to a
£5 per head increase in council tax in England and Wales, falling to £3 per head as local
authorities found alternatives to landfill.81
3. Fly-tipping
The second issue that Customs found caused especial concern was the impact of the new tax
on fly-tipping:82 
5. Effect  on  fly-tipping
Concern over fly-tipping was one of the most common themes in responses received.
273 respondents (38 per cent) believed that the tax could or would lead to an increase
in fly-tipping. Of these, 187 were from local authorities (57 per cent of local
authorities who replied). Thirteen site operators also believed that the tax might
increase fly-tipping, as did a number of trade associations.
The following concerns/questions about the fly-tipping issue recurred within these
replies:
• Fly-tipping will increase which will be detrimental to the environment and thus
counter to one of the main objectives of the tax.
• Who will remove fly-tipped waste and who, if anyone, will pay the tax on it?
• Both local authorities and Customs will find it difficult to detect and enforce any
penalties given their lack of resources.
• Greater policing and penalties must be introduced to deal with fly-tipping.
At the time, the Government conceded fly-tipping could be a problem, but that the existing
regulatory regime would be sufficient deterrent against its growth:83
Other countries which have a landfall tax in place appear not to have significant
problems with fly-tipping, although the Government is naturally concerned to see that

waste disposal methods are adequately policed after the introduction of the tax. The
main security against fly-tipping is the regulatory framework. Regulations
implemented on 1 May 1994 introduced a new waste management licensing system.
These controls, along with section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and
the associated duty of care for waste which came into force on 1 April 1992, are
intended to address the problem of fly-tipping, amongst other matters. They should
provide a strong regulatory framework to support the new tax. Further thought will
be given to the policing of the landfall tax and of waste disposal methods over the
coming months.
The Government reiterated its position on fly-tipping at the time of the November 1995
Budget:84 
The Government has also responded to concern expressed during the consultation
exercise that fly-tipping may increase as a result of the tax. The current waste
management licensing system and duty of care for waste provide a strong regulatory
framework to support the tax. Fly-tipping is already a criminal offence and the
Government therefore sees no need to make it a revenue offence in tax law.
However, it will take further steps to combat fly-tipping when the tax is implemented.
In particular, the Environment Agencies will be asked to give a high priority to the
prevention of fly-tipping. The courts will be reminded about the environmental
impact of fly-tipping and the financial gains which are made by perpetrators.
Further details of the Government\'s policy to deal with fly-tipping were given by the
Secretary of State:85
Sir David Steel: To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment if he
will make a statement outlining the respective roles of his Department and
the new Environment Agency in implementing the landfall tax, with special
reference to what new steps will be taken to prevent illegal dumping and fly
tipping in the countryside, and to relieve landowners on whose property such
waste is deposited from liability to pay the tax when they transport it to
designated landfill sites.
Mr. Gummer: My Department is responsible for the overall regulatory
framework for waste management in England and Wales. Regulations
implemented on 1 May 1994 introduced a new waste management licensing
system. The associated duty of care for waste came into force on 1 April
1992. The penalties that can be imposed for offences relating to waste are
already severe, and these controls provide a strong regulatory framework to
support the introduction of the landfill tax. My Department will also write
to the courts before the start of the tax on 1 October 1996, to draw their

attention to the financial gains that can be made by those who dispose of
waste illegally.
The Environment Agency is the competent authority for the purposes of
waste management licensing. The agency has the resources and the expertise
to advise on the legal and sound management of waste, to investigate
offences and to carry out enforcement action. The Government\'s guidance
to the agency on its objectives and contribution to sustainable development,
which will be laid before Parliament very shortly, will clarify its role in this
area. Ministers will expect the agency to act upon its powers and to review
procedures for preventing and handling cases of fly tipping. The
Government have no plans to relieve the occupiers of land on which waste
is deposited illegally from liability to pay landfill tax where they dispose of
the waste to licensed landfill sites.
Most recently, when asked what steps would be taken to increase the penalties for fly-tipping
following the introduction of the tax, the government pointed out that the penalties were
already severe, and summarised the existing maximum penalties for waste related offences
in a written answer. For the unlawful deposit or disposal of non-special or special waste,
these are imprisonment for six months and/or a fine of £20,000 following prosecution in the
Magistrates\' court, or imprisonment for two years and/or an unlimited fine in the Crown
court86. 
C. Introduction of the tax 
In his 1995 Budget speech, the Chancellor confirmed that the new tax would come into
operation on 1 October 1996:87
Last year I proposed a new landfill tax, which is a charge on the disposal
of waste in, for example, tips and old quarries. That will come into effect
on 1 October 1996. It will be charged at a standard rate of £7 a tonne and
a lower rate of £2 for inactive waste. That is a tax on waste in order to
enable me to reduce the tax on jobs. The money raised by the landfill tax
will allow for a matching cut in the main rate of employers\' national
insurance contributions by a further 0.2 per cent to 10 per cent from April
1997. That will cut the cost of employment by half a billion pounds and
will make it cheaper for businesses to create new jobs.
Legislation to bring in the tax was included in the Finance Bill, introduced in January 1996.88

Research Paper 96/103
In setting the rates of tax at £7 and £2 per tonne, the Government was keen to emphasize the
purpose of the tax was not to severely curtail landfill use as such, let alone stop it. Rather,
the tax would help to align more closely the price charged for landfill, and the true costs of
using it. This point was illustrated well in an exchange during the proceedings of the Finance
Bill, between the then Paymaster General, David Heathcoat-Amory, and Dawn Primarolo
MP:89
I repeat the point that capturing those external costs, whether they be
pollution or a form of nuisance to residents and others, is an important
consideration. It will encourage the waste producers, whoever they may be,
to look for ways to produce less waste and to reuse and recycle more waste
if they cannot avoid producing it. We know that there is substantial scope
for businesses and others to adopt better waste management practices. The
tax will give them a precise incentive to continue to do so.
In other words, what we are proposing will reinforce the existing policy of
sustainable waste management, which was set out in considerable detail in
the White Paper published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
the Environment last month. The concept in the White Paper was of a waste
hierarchy, headed by waste minimisation. The most desirable aim must be
not to produce so much waste. Lower down the hierarchy is reusing waste.
Further down again comes the recovery of waste, which can include
recycling, composting and energy recovery from incineration. The hon.
Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson), who is no longer in her
place, was under the misapprehension that the landfill tax would somehow
act as a disincentive or inhibition on composting. In fact, the reverse is the
case, as the hierarchy shows. If waste can be composted, it will avoid
landfill tax. At the bottom of the waste hierarchy is disposal, which includes
landfill.
The landfill tax will be an important means of moving waste up the
hierarchy and away from landfill. The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms
Primarolo) said, bafflingly, that the tax would send a signal that landfill was
the most desirable means of disposal. That calls into question her
understanding of the whole principle of the tax because the reverse is the
case. By taxing landfill, we are providing an incentive to move to other,
more environmentally benign means of dealing with waste.
Ms Primarolo: A study for the Department of the Environment undertaken
by Coopers and Lybrand showed that with a levy on landfill even as high
as £20 per tonne, recycling would still remain a relatively unattractive
financial option and that the use of the tax alone would not be enough to
develop alternatives. Therefore, essentially the Government are saying that
landfall is all right or that options that are worse than landfill but cheaper
are also all right.
Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: The hon. Lady is now arguing for a much higher

rate of tax, which can only double the anxiety expressed by some of my
hon. Friends. If she is suggesting that the modest tax we are proposing will
not boost recycling in the way that we wish, that is an argument for a higher
charge. We do not accept that. Although the tax will not overnight create
vast quantities of recycled waste, that might be a good thing. By flooding
the market with recycled products we might kill the very process that we are
trying to promote. We believe that the tax rates of £2 and £7 will at least
nudge the market towards a greater use of recycled materials and therefore
move waste generally up the hierarchy that I described earlier.
At separate stages in the Finance Bill\'s progress, it was suggested that it was unfair to
penalise landfill sites that were well run, and that dealt just with entirely safe and innocuous
materials. In reply, the then Paymaster General, David Heathcoat-Amory, made an important
point:90
By taxing landfill, we will encourage the development of alternative ways
of dealing with waste. Indeed, it will lead to less waste in the first place.
That justification for the tax is valid even if the landfill site is well
engineered ...
The tax is designed not only to tax waste with the potential to pollute water
or air, but to catch the external costs associated with the landfilling or rubble
waste and all categories of inactive waste. Such activities are not without
environmental impact. I am sure that some letters from my hon. Friends\'
constituents, who live near landfill sites, reflect the problems cause by noise,
dust, smell, seagulls and lorry movements. Those represent an external cost
of landfilling even inactive or inert waste. The tax is designed to capture
those costs and to attribute them to the producer of the waste. The proposed
lower rate of tax at £2 per tonne reflects the lower impact on the
environment caused by that category of waste.
During the proceedings of the Finance Bill in spring 1996, a variety of industries argued that
certain types of waste be exempted completely from the new tax, or covered by the lower £2
inert charge.91 As it turned out, three types of waste were specified as exempt from tax:
dredgings from waterways, natural waste from mines and quarries and waste from the
reclamation of historically contaminated land. In March details of the types of waste to be
charged the lower £2 per tonne rate of tax were given:92
Mr. Matthew Banks: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what was the
outcome of the Customs and Excise consultation exercise on the scope of
the lower rate of landfill tax.

Research Paper 96/103
Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: Customs and Excise have now analyzed the replies
which they received to the consultation exercise on the scope of the lower
rate of landfill tax. On the basis of the information provided and
representation made, we have concluded that the lower rate of landfill tax
should apply to the wastes listed. Mixtures consisting only of listed wastes
will qualify for the lower rate, as will water with suspended solids consisted
only of listed wastes.
In order to be taxable at the lower rate, listed wastes   or mixtures of such
wastes   must not contain or be contaminated with any material which is not
listed. If they are, the standard rate of tax will apply. But a de minimis level
will apply to enable wastes to qualify for the lower rate if they consist
wholly of listed wastes, apart from a small quantity of material which is not
listed, provided that the material does not lead to any potential for pollution.
Where wastes appear on the lower rate list and are also covered by an
exemption, the exemption will apply.

clay, sand, gravel, sandstone, limestone, crushed stone, china clay, clean building
or demolition stone such as sandstone, limestone or slate, topsoil, peat, coal, silt
and dredgings.

Ceramics, including bricks (see below for bricks with plaster), tiles, clay ware,

Gypsum and plaster
These will be subject to the lower rate only if disposed of in landfall sites
licensed only to take inactive or inert waste.
Other wastes
There are, in addition to the above, a few wastes on which Custom and Excise
are seeking further information before a conclusion is reached as to whether the
lower rate is appropriate.
Mixtures consisting of these wastes, it was explained, would qualify for the lower rate.
Mixtures that contained a small quantity of active waste - chargeable at the £7 rate - would
still qualify for the lower rate provided the mixture posed no risk of pollution.
For its part, the Institute of Wastes Management was sceptical of the value in charging the
tax at an inert rate and an active rate:93
[During the 1970s and 80s...] Inert waste as a term was suitably ambiguous for
operators and regulators to use when disposing of builders rubble, construction waste,
spoil, soil and other extraneous materials. Most of these materials were in fact
anything but inert and contributed to leachate, landfill gas and settlement on old and
not so old landfill sites. The term became notorious, and quite rightly, went out of
use as the potential environmental harm from such wastes became more widely
understood. 
Following details of the landfill tax announcement in November 1995, we now learn
that the lower rate of landfill tax will be levied on \'inactive\' wastes which \'do not
physically or chemically react, biodegrade or adversely affect other matter with which
it comes into contact in a way likely to give rise to environmental pollution\'. Such
wastes include naturally occurring rocks and subsoils, uncontaminated materials, glass,
ceramics and concrete.
Leaving aside the relative \'inactivity\' of these materials, a number of questions are
raised by this. When in practice are these wastes delivered to a disposal facility
(landfill) uncontaminated? Will a saving of £5 per tonne be a sufficient financial
incentive for waste producers to ensure that their wastes are inactive and therefore
qualify for the lower rate tax? Will the regulatory system be able to identify
satisfactorily that which is truly inactive and uncontaminated against the opposite?
More to the point, will the driving force behind such an inspection system be a
financial one (higher or lower tax) or an environmental (inactive or active waste) one?
During the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, the Labour Party suggested that a third tax
rate of £15 could be levied on "special waste". The Government opposed this, on the grounds
that this category had not been defined, that hazardous waste was subject to tight controls as

it was, and that the tax should be simple and easy to understand. In the event, the proposal
was rejected.94
At the time of the November 1995 Budget, Customs issued a compliance cost assessment on
the impact the new tax would have on business, focusing on those required to account for the
tax to Customs (ie, those who run landfill sites). About 1,400 businesses will be required to
register with Customs, operating about 2,700 sites overall. The industry is dominated by
small firms; the largest five companies in this sector, who each have a turnover in excess of
£100 million, represent about 20 per cent of the market. For larger operators, it was thought
start up costs associated with the tax would be around £25,000 to £50,000; continuing
compliance costs might be around £4,000 per year. Estimates received from small firms put
the equivalent costs for this size of company at about £750 for initial costs. In relation to
compliance costs, Customs felt many small firms overestimated how much they would need
to set aside (in reply, firms gave figures between £200 and £2,500+ per quarter, with an
average of £1,400). Firms were, it felt, giving large estimates for the costs of routine record
keeping and form filling, aggregating landfill costs with costs associated with Customs
generally, and exaggerating the frequency of Customs\' visits. 
All told, Customs felt annual compliance costs for small firms would be toward the lower end
of the estimates range (ie, in the region of £800 per year). The assessment concluded that
"given the extent to which the tax will fit in with existing practice", implementing waste
management regulations and accounting for VAT to Customs, "the cost of complying with
the tax should be very low." It went on to note that the two main policy alternatives to a tax
- tighter regulation, or requiring the industry adopt alternative practices - "would be against
the spirit of the Government\'s deregulation initiative and would be less economically efficient
than using a market-based approach."95
Consultation has marked the history of the new tax. Initially it was proposed that company
directors should be jointly and severally liable for any landfill tax due from their company.
In effect, directors would be personally liable for the tax. The use of this power - employed
in the betting and gaming field - had been thought appropriate since landfill companies would
have few assets in cases of insolvency, and - certainly in relation to inactive waste - the tax
charge could represent a high percentage of the total value of any transaction.96 With a much
higher proportion of the tax at risk in such cases, the Government had thought making
directors responsible would be a good solution, but following strong opposition, it withdrew
this provision.97 Moreover, in February, Customs emphasized that to begin with it would

apply penalty rules for tax collection sympathetically:98
The Department will take a sympathetic view of genuine errors made as a result of
unfamiliarity with or misunderstanding of the tax provision during its first year.
However, Customs reserve the right to assess the duty properly due, when considering
whether to impose penalties and interest. Similar arrangements were made during the
introduction of insurance premium tax and air passenger duty. This means operators
will not be penalised for a first default in the first year, unless it was thought that
deliberate evasion or manipulation was involved.
In a pamphlet on environmental taxes published by the Institute for Public Policy Research,
the authors praised the long consultation process that had shaped the final design of the tax:99
The new landfill tax is a good model of how a tax ought to be introduced. It was
announced in 1994, details were announced in 1995 and, following extensive
consultation, it is being implemented in 1996. The consultation was genuine, and the
design of the tax has been totally altered as a result (it will be based on weight rather
than being ad valorem as the Government originally proposed). This is a new
departure, not only for environmental policy, but for British tax policy generally.
Again all political parties have supported it, as have all environmental groups. Even
business has not complained too much, although there has been some lobbying on
what should constitute inert waste and so be liable for a lower rate.
The Government\'s goals for the new tax were restated by the Environment Minister, James
Clappison, in a press notice issued on the eve of its introduction:100
The landfill tax represents a significant new policy. The shift from taxing
employment to taxing resources has rightly been an aim of the EU but it is the UK
that is setting the pace. It marks an important step in extending the use of economic
instruments to achieve environmental objectives. The central purpose of the tax is to
ensure that landfill costs reflect the full cost of the environmental impact of the
activity. By doing this business and consumers are encouraged, in a cost effective
and non-regulatory manner, to produce less waste, and to reuse or recover value from
more waste.
Of course, the purpose of the tax as a revenue raising device should not be ignored. A
written answer in April 1996 gave estimates for the amount of money the Government

expects to collect:101
Mr. Sheerman: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what is the
current estimate of the revenue to be expected from the landfill tax;
(2) what is his estimate of the revenue available for environmental trusts
from the landfill tax;
Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: The estimated net revenue yield from landfill tax
is £450 million in a full year. However, because precise figures about the
amount of waste sent to landfill are not available centrally, the revenue
estimate for the tax is open to a greater than usual margin of error. The
estimate assumes that credits of tax amounting to £50 million will be given
to site operators in respect of voluntary contributions they make to
environmental trusts, although, on the basis of the revenue projection for the
tax and the maximum credit entitlement, as much as £100 million is
potentially available for trusts in a full year.
Some critics of the tax have suggested that the absence of precise figures on the amount of
waste going into landfill sites is telling, and that it is by no means certain that the new impost
will achieve any of the goals the Government has set for it.102 This question is examined in
more detail in the following section of this paper.
IV What effects will the tax have?
A. How much money will it raise?
The Government\'s position remains that the revenue from the tax will be around £450 million
in a full year and around £110 million in the six months of its operation in 1996/97103. There
has never been any question, however, that these are extremely approximate figures. For two
major reasons HM Customs & Excise will remain unsure of exactly how much will be
collected until the tax has been fully operative for a length of time.
First, and of most significance, are the uncertainties concerning the amount of waste going
to landfill. It was agreed in meetings between the Department of the Environment and HM
Customs & Excise that revenue forecasts would, of necessity, be based on the Department of

Research Paper 96/103
Environment\'s estimates of the amounts of waste landfilled in around 1990104. These
estimates, summarised in section II, suggest that around 125 million tonnes of wastes eligible
for the tax are landfilled annually. In translating estimates of landfilled waste into estimates
of tax revenue the Government have assumed that much of the 44 million tonnes of landfilled
construction and demolition waste will be inactive and therefore charged at the lower rate of
£2 per tonne, as will some of the 50 million tonnes of landfilled industrial waste. The vast
majority of household and commercial wastes will be active and liable to the higher rate of
£7 per tonne105. 
The basis of the revenue estimates is itself somewhat doubtful; the Department of the
Environment accepts that106:
"much of the needed information [on waste management] is not readily available at
present, or is available with insufficient precision to enable reliable estimates ... to be
made".
Indeed, until the Landfill Tax is fully operative, accurate data on the amounts of waste going
to landfill will remain unavailable. Consequently, HM Customs & Excise describe their
revenue forecasts as best estimates within a range of possibilities107. This is true even in
terms of the uncertainties surrounding estimates of landfilling in 1990. There is also the
added complication of changes in the level of landfill in the subsequent six years. 
There have been suggestions that the Government\'s estimates of the amount of waste going
to landfill are outdated and may overstate the actual annual amount of landfilled waste by as
much as 30 million tonnes108. Some limited data in this area are available for waste
(household and commercial) collected by waste disposal authorities. Figures for the 50
WDAs (around half of all WDAs) who reported their landfilling activities to CIPFA in both
1992/93 and 1994/95 show a collective fall of around 10% in the amounts sent to landfill,
from around 15.7 million tonnes to just over 14 million tonnes109. While these WDAs may
not be representative of all WDAs, and certainly the figures are in contrast to those for
Scotland (see page 10) which show an increase of 25% in the landfilling of all controlled
waste over a two year period, the figures suggest the possibility of a declining tax base.
Second, there is the question of behavioural changes in response to the imposition of the tax.

Research Paper 96/103
Because, again, of the uncertainties surrounding landfill data, HM Customs & Excise have
not been able to incorporate an accurate estimate of the reduction in landfilling consequent
on the introduction of the tax into their revenue estimates. In practice110:
"the price elasticity of demand for landfill [will] depend on the suitability and
availability of alternative waste management practices. This will vary to some extent
across the country and between different types of waste. It will also vary over time
as the practices of waste producers and handlers change to reflect policies contained
in the [Government\'s] waste strategy."
Too little is known about each of these factors for any reliable projection of behavioural
changes to be made. Given, moreover, the unreliability of their basic revenue projection, HM
Customs & Excise believe that the introduction of a further complicating variable would be
fruitless. In any case, the views of a number of commentators111 suggest that the behavioural
effects of the tax are likely to be minimal in the short term at existing rates.
B. What effect will the tax have on local authorities?
The concerns raised by local authorities during the consultation on the tax (summarised in
section III above) focused on the additional costs they will have to pay to landfill household
waste. The tax will be levied on the operators of landfill sites who, in turn are expected to
pass it on to their customers including local authorities. While local authorities will be able
to recover the cost of landfilling commercial waste directly from their customers, the cost of
landfilling domestic waste will have to be met from their own resources. The Government
argue that they have made provision for additional local authority expenditure in 1996/97
through the local government financial settlement for this year112 and that the cost in future
years will be offset by the reduction in national insurance contributions113. Nevertheless, they
accept that local authorities as a whole will spend more on the tax than they save through the
reduction in contributions114.
Once again, estimates of the impact of the tax on local authorities are beset by the lack of
knowledge on how much waste they landfill. As a whole the local authorities of England and
Wales have budgeted for £74 million of expenditure on the tax in 1996/97, and in a full year
are expected to spend around twice this amount, £143 million115. This is slightly higher than

Research Paper 96/103
the Government\'s estimate, based on the assumption that local authorities are continuing to
landfill around 18 million tonnes annually, almost all of which is active waste liable for the
£7 rate of tax, of £126 million for local authorities across the UK116. The Association of
Metropolitan Authorities suggest a figure of around £154 million117.
The cost to individual local authorities will depend upon their existing use of landfill and the
availability of alternative management methods. The non-metropolitan authorities who,
because of the availability of land, have tended to make greater use of landfill than their
metropolitan counterparts are likely to face particularly large bills. If authorities continue to
landfill to 1994/95 levels, the average cost for a non-metropolitan authority could be as much
£1.7 million in a full year, compared with around £0.9 million for a metropolitan authority118.
Kent County Council, for example, may face a bill in the region of £5 million if they
continue to landfill at a similar level as in 1994/95, when they landfilled some three-quarters
of a million tonnes of household waste119. Surrey County Council have already estimated
their likely full year expenditure at around £3 million120. In most cases, however, the non-
metropolitan authorities have a larger taxbase from which to finance their expenditure. 
It has been suggested that this year\'s expenditure of £74 million in England and Wales has
been met through cuts in other areas of local authority budgets121:
"A similar figure, £73 million, has been cut this year from councils\' highway and
transportation budgets ... Philip Ramsdale, executive director of the Institute of Public
Finance (the commercial arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy), who oversaw the research, says that though linking the cuts to new
environmental spending commitments is simplistic, it does give a reasonable
overview. \'It may well be that this is not a conscious approach in individual
authorities, but in overall terms that seems to be what is happening\', he says." 
For 1997/8 the concern is that, in the absence of any compensatory grants from the
Government, the full cost of the landfill tax, net of the offsetting reductions in national
insurance contributions, will have to be met through a combination of service reductions and
council tax increases. While it is accepted that local authorities will pay more in tax than
they will gain through the reduction in contributions, the precise net impact is not known.
On the basis of the figures produced by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, however,
the £154 million cost of the tax would be offset by a £60 million reduction in national
insurance contributions, leaving local authorities to find more than £90 million in a full year.

Assuming that the full burden is passed on to council taxpayers, this would be equivalent to
an increase of around £5 for a band D taxpayer122.
Beyond 1997/98, the burden on local authorities and council taxpayers will, of course, depend
largely on the extent to which local authorities are able to find alternative methods of waste
management. A further factor is the possibility of increases in the rate of the tax, a scenario
which some commentators believe to be inevitable so long as the tax rate is below the level
at which landfill becomes more expensive than alternative methods. Paul Ekin, of the
industrial forecasters Cambridge Econometrics, believes that the Government will
progressively increase the rate of the tax once it is established123. Tony Hammond, chairman
of the local authority recycling advisory committee goes further, suggesting that:124
"Everybody is expecting the Chancellor to increase the amount of the landfill tax in
this year\'s Budget. Realistically, I think we can expect a Landfill Tax of £20 a ton
within two or three years, whichever party is in power".
If tax rates are indeed increased there is no guarantee that there will be further compensatory
cuts in rates of national insurance contributions. The link made between contributions and
the tax in this year does not signify a permanent hypothecation of tax revenues, but was a
presentational link; a future chancellor would not be obliged to put any additional tax
revenues into reducing contribution rates125. Local authorities are therefore likely to have to
meet the cost of any future increases in tax rates in full.
C. What impact will the tax have on waste disposal?
The imposition of a landfill tax has been generally welcomed by environmentalists; it has
been one of the obvious candidates for green taxation126. The announcement that the tax
would be weight-based was also welcomed. The alternative was an ad valorem tax (see page
25), but this was opposed by environmental groups who feared that it would encourage
disposers to drive further, to cheaper less well-run sites. There is debate, however, about
whether the tax will have the desired effect and significantly reduce the amount of waste
going to landfill:127

Research Paper 96/103
"The landfill tax is an important and welcome innovation, the first new tax introduced
for genuine environmental reasons in the UK. But it is deficient in three respects.
First, it is too low, and is unlikely to alter significantly the amount of waste going to
landfill. The Government should have announced that the £7 rate was a first
instalment, and that there would be annual increases until the tax had a more
substantial incentive effect. This would have sent a clear signal to waste producers,
without inducing a sudden jump in their costs." 
The same commentators call for a higher rate tax band for special waste and for a tax to be
applied to all waste disposal, with perhaps incineration attracting a lower levy. 
Prior to the announcement of the rates of duty to be charged on landfill, the Institute for
Fiscal Studies was not hopeful that the tax would affect the amount of landfill significantly:128
Crucially, the success of the policy relies on the government choosing an appropriate
tax rate that adequately reflects the costs of landfill. In general, the social costs of
landfill will depend upon the nature of the waste. Inert waste such as building rubble
will result in little environmental degradation relative to toxic substances.
Externalities will also vary with location of the landfill site. Waste deposited in urban
landfill sites need not be transported as far as waste generated in rural areas and so
the social costs of rural landfill generally tend to be higher than those of urban
landfill. Externalities associated with landfill without energy recovery129 have been
estimated by the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment
(CSERGE) as being around £3.50 per tonne in urban areas and £4.00 in rural areas,
although these figures should be interpreted with caution since they do not include
other significant impacts on the community such as noise, odour, unsightliness, etc.
Although it would be appropriate for tax rates to capture differences in externalities,
this is likely to increase both administration and compliance costs. In view of this,
the Chancellor is expected to announce two rates, a lower one for inert waste and a
higher one for more environmentally damaging waste. It is likely that the higher rate
will be at least £4 per tonne if it is to reflect the external effects of landfill ...
In addition to increasing the tax burden on industry, the proposed levy will also have
a significant impact upon local authorities that are responsible for the collection and
disposal of all household waste and some commercial waste. IFS estimates for
England suggest that local authorities\' total waste disposal costs will increase by
approximately £87m. Of this, around £40m will be paid purely on the collection of
domestic waste. Assuming that there will be no corresponding increase in grants from
central to local government to help ease the burden of the levy, and that increases in
costs occurring from the collection of domestic waste will be purely borne by
households and not businesses, then a tax of £5 per tonne will, on average, lead to an

increase in B and D council taxes of around £3.80 per year.
By itself, the landfill levy is unlikely to have a significant impact upon the amount
of waste generated. Whilst the current system of charging for domestic refuse
disposal is incorporated into council tax bills, there will be no incentive for
households to reduce waste. Consequently, if the government is to reach its target of
stabilising the production of household waste at its 1995 level, it will be necessary to
introduce further measures.
Nor do environmental groups and the waste management industry appear certain that the tax
will significantly affect the reliance on landfill by those disposing of rubbish:130
The Environmental Services Association, the trade body which represents waste
collection companies, said yesterday that the tax would add to costs and push up
council tax bills. Friends of the Earth, however, said the tax was not high enough to
achieve its objective of reducing the amount of rubbish dumped in landfill sites. \'It\'s
a small green step in the right direction. But it won\'t really work,\' said FoE
campaigner Mike Childs. On this point the two sides agree. ESA chairman and chief
executive, Peter Neill, said: \'I am sceptical whether isolated economic instruments will
be enough to encourage sustainable waste management.\'
... FoE cites a study for the Government by consultants Coopers & Lybrand which
estimated that the current level of tax will increase recycling by only 1 per cent. It
wants the tax set at a minimum £30 per tonne and it wants that sum also levied on
incineration, to avoid the levy diverting waste from landfill sites to incinerators, which
it believes are dangerous and do not encourage sustainability. The industry is
concerned that now the tax is in place, the sum could easily be increased by a hard-up
Chancellor, just like tax on booze or cigarettes. And it argues that a hefty landfill bill
will increase illegal fly-tipping. There is not even agreement on the greenest part of
the plan - the creation of Environmental Trusts, financed by up to 20 per cent of the
tax revenues. Everyone agrees they are a good thing, but FoE worries that they will
be supervised by a regulator largely controlled by the industry ...
While one view is that the levy could or should be progressively raised, another is that its
usefulness may eventually wane, as landfill regulation and controls tighten. In their report
for the DoE, Coopers & Lybrand said that one of the reasons for introducing a landfill levy
was:131 
"...to cover the external (environmental) costs associated with landfill that are not fully
reflected in the existing pricing structure - for example, landfills generate methane
which contributes, inter alia, to global warming, leakage from decomposing waste can

damage water courses and there may be disturbance costs from waste delivery and
odour - insofar as ever tightening regulation of landfill operations will internalise
these costs, the justification for a levy may also diminish."
Coopers & Lybrand argued that a levy would be unlikely to have any significant effect on
the amount of waste being landfilled in the short term132 and that incineration would be likely
to remain an attractive option throughout England and Wales; recycling was expected to be
relatively unattractive even with a levy set at £20 per tonne. 
The 1993 DoE report Externalities from Landfill and Incineration133 - which examined the
environmental case for a levy - pointed out that the externalities associated with incineration
and landfilling were fairly obvious (disamenity, litter, noise, smell, local disturbance, local
and global pollution and transport effects) but difficult to express in monetary terms.
Nevertheless the report indicated that a levy in the range of £5-8 per tonne of controlled
waste landfilled would reflect the international benefit of air pollution displacement from
energy recovery; and £3-6 would be appropriate if only the UK benefit were taken into
account. Importantly, the report was not intended to estimate the size of a levy as such:
"Government may wish to bring various considerations other than the size of the externality
into the setting of a levy." 
As mentioned above, Friends of the Earth have called for the landfill tax to be set at £30 per
tonne and for incineration and other forms of waste disposal to be covered as well134. FoE
Scotland has described the landfill tax as a \'missed opportunity\' which will have some
negative effects in making incineration more attractive; a waste tax on the other hand would
have encouraged recycling. FoE Scotland has also pointed out that with the different costs
of landfill around the country, the charge might be little noticed in the South-East or London
where landfill costs are already high, but could double the cost of landfill in Scotland.135 The
chairman of the Recycling Advisory Group Scotland has called the landfill tax "correct in
principle but flawed in practice."136
The managing director of 3C Waste, one of Britain\'s largest waste management companies,
has called the landfill tax a \'disaster\' which will raise disposal costs for all businesses and
households and "worse still, encourage fly-tipping in our hedgerows and on remote land and
roadside verges." The tax is, he feels, not aimed at the real polluters who use unlicensed
landfill sites, falsify licenses or already dump rubbish illegally, and nor can alternatives, such

as recycling, be developed quickly enough without real markets.137 
On the other hand, the managing director of UK Waste, the company which released the
results of its survey of landfill sites in 1994 (see page 19) has said the landfill tax will act as
"an important catalyst for waste minimisation, recovery, and recycling in the UK" by
dramatically raising the cost of waste disposal by landfill and giving waste producers a
financial as well as environmental incentive to seek ways to reduce the amount of waste
which they send to landfill.138
The Institute of Wastes Management has suggested that the landfill tax will be \'not very\'
significant: "the majority of waste will still go to landfill and life as we know it will go on."
The reasons for this include the fact that some large companies have told landfill operators
that they do not intend to pay the increased landfill rates and are expecting operators to
absorb the tax if they want their business. If operators decline to do this, \'cowboys\' will be
waiting to offer their services. The IWM says that with regard to recycling, \'many leading
figures\' have predicted that it will provide very little spur. The point is also made that many
incinerators are having to close at the moment because they do not meet modern emission
control standards.139 Indeed, in their report,140 Coopers & Lybrand pointed out that
incineration capacity would not be great enough until the end of the decade to realise the
potential switch from landfill to incineration.
D. What role will environmental trusts have?
The 1993 Coopers & Lybrand report141 on landfill suggested that one possible although not
attractive reason for a landfill levy could be to provide a clean up fund for managing later
environmental difficulties which might arise. A system of Environmental Trusts was first
suggested in the landfill tax consultation paper142 as a means of providing tax rebates for
landfill operators making payments to trusts for specified environmental improvements. This
would reflect the environmental impact of landfill and further encourage the development of
alternatives. The payments made will be limited to restoration of closed landfill sites (or
damage caused by such sites) when liability is unclear, research into and development of new
waste technologies, or pilot projects for waste minimisation, recycling, composting and energy
recovery. At the time of the November 1995 Budget, it was announced that site operators
would be able to claim a rebate of 90 per cent of their annual contributions, up to a maximum

of 20 per cent of their landfill tax bill in any given year.143 The Secretary of State for the
Environment, John Gummer, has said that the trusts will "strengthen the environmental
credentials of the landfill tax" and have the potential to generate up to about £100 million of
private sector expenditure for environmental improvement.144
A working group chaired by the DoE and including the waste management industry, other
industries that landfill their own waste, the CBI, environmental groups involved in waste
management and land remediation and local authority associations was established to decide how
the trusts would operate. The activities in which trusts may be able to become involved, subject
to approval by the Government, include:
    • research into, and development of, more sustainable waste
management practices and the provision of education, information
and support for innovative projects (examples here might include
research into new technology, pilot projects or training schemes
aimed at waste minimisation, re-use, recycling, composting and
energy recovery);
     • collection and dissemination of information about waste management
and more sustainable waste management practices;
     • remediation, restoration and amenity improvement of sites which are
not able to support economic or social use due to past waste
management or other industrial activities (providing that no benefit
accrues to a person who caused or knowingly permitted the
environmental damage or is anyway liable for its remediation); and
    • provision of environmental, amenity and recreational facilities in the
vicinity of landfill sites, eg creation of habitats, wildlife and
conservation areas.
The trusts will be non-profit distributing bodies within the private sector and when they were
announced it was made clear that HM Customs & Excise would approve a regulatory body
to monitor the scheme\'s operation and audit the trusts\' expenditure. This body, the
Environmental Trust Regulatory Body Ltd, or Entrust, was launched in October 1996.145
Entrust is a private sector body which will enrol environmental organisations as approved
bodies to receive funding from landfill operators. Entrust will have a ten-strong board of
which five members have so far been announced; its chairman will be the Earl of
Cranbrook146. Some environmental groups have criticised the links between members of

Entrust\'s board and the waste disposal industry:147
\'This is designed to exclude green organisations who might ask challenging questions,\'
said Tony Juniper, deputy campaigns director at FoE. \'It is going to oversee spending
of public money. It needs to be truly independent and run by people with no axe to
grind.\' But Lord Cranbrook said that the executive\'s experience of the landfill
industry would be advantageous. \'We have to regulate and decide priorities in the
environmental field. Many of these landfill operators do see themselves as working
for the environment,\' he said. \'I am chairman of Shanks & McEwan\'s advisory board.
It has given me quite wide experience of the sort of things that might arise from
landfill sites. But we are quite separate from Shanks & McEwan.\' 
For its part, the Institute for Fiscal Studies was unenthusiastic about the prospective impact
of environmental trusts, in its discussion of landfill tax published in its Green Budget in
October 1995:148
A second feature of the government\'s proposals is that landfill businesses are to
receive tax rebates on money they pay into environmental trusts, approved by
government, involved in the restoration of closed landfill sites or research and
development into sustainable waste management practices. It is envisaged that rebates
on payments would never be more than 90%. This should ensure that firms will have
an incentive to check that their payments are being used carefully. Although the
waste disposal industry has broadly welcomed the idea of environmental trusts, the
measure can be interpreted as a move towards hypothecation, albeit under a different
name, and over the long term, these rebates may also be a somewhat unsustainable
practice. From an environmental perspective, the main purpose of the tax is to reduce
the amount of waste going to landfill, but at the same time the rebates are to be used
to promote long-term objectives such as research and development and restoration of
old landfill sites. However, it is expected that revenues from the tax should dwindle
over time as firms adopt alternative measures for waste disposal, and so this will
undoubtedly constrain the government\'s ability to fund future rebate payments.
Furthermore, since it is essentially the private sector rather than government that will
be responsible for the trusts\' activities, these new environmental expenditures will not
appear in the public finances.

Research Paper 96/103
E. The cut in National Insurance Contributions (NICs)
When he announced the introduction of landfill tax in his 1995 Budget speech, Kenneth
Clarke proposed that the money raised by the new tax would be used to cut National
Insurance Contributions (NICs): "The money raised by the landfill tax will allow for a
matching cut in the main rate of employers\' national insurance contributions by a further 0.2
per cent to 10 per cent from April 1997. That will cut the cost of employment by half a
billion pounds and will make it cheaper for businesses to create new jobs."149
The authors of a recent pamphlet on environmental taxes published by the Institute for Public
Policy Research applauded the principle at stake in cutting NICs:150
The concept of a green tax reform is not nearly as widely debated in the UK as in
many other European countries, but it has been gaining support gradually in recent
years. Conservative Chancellor Kenneth Clarke signed up to the principle when he
linked the new landfill tax to a reduction in employers\' National Insurance
Contributions, saying: "I want to increase the tax on polluters, and make further cuts
in the tax on jobs". (The Treasury subsequently pointed out that this was not
hypothecation but a presentational link - a future Chancellor is not obliged to put any
extra revenues from the landfill tax into reducing NICS). However, the landfill tax
raises a comparatively small amount of money, around half a million pounds a year,
so the shift cannot be said to be significant, and the 1995 Budget contained no new
taxes on polluters ...
Some concern has been expressed by trade unionists about the weakening of the
contributory principle if employers\' National Insurance Contributions are reduced
(although it is perhaps worth remembering that radical trade unions opposed the
introduction of National Insurance when Lloyd George proposed it in 1911, arguing
that benefits should be paid out of general taxation). The contributory principle is a
fiction    National Insurance Contributions are not nearly large enough to cover what
they are supposed to fund. The notion that employers should take responsibility for
some aspects of their employees\' well-being is a noble sentiment, and in an age of full
employment or labour scarcity would be worthy of strong support. Sadly, in an age
of mass unemployment when public policy makers need in effect to induce employers
to take on more workers, it appears something of a luxury. What matters to
individuals, in this context, is that they have a job and that there is a decent welfare
system. The way in which the revenue is raised to finance the welfare system is
surely a second order concern, and it must be sensible to organise the tax system in
a way which maximises employment.
In any case, opposition to reductions in employers\' NICs should not be taken as

opposition to the concept of green tax reform, only as opposition to one variant of it.
The revenues could equally be used to cut income tax, business rates, corporation tax
or VAT.
However, in its Green Budget published in October 1995, the Institute for Fiscal Studies
argued that the cut in employer NICs would be unlikely to have much of an effect:151
The tax, imposed at a rate of £3-5 per tonne, would raise in the region of £300-500m
per annum, permitting a reduction in the main rate of employer NICs of 0.2
percentage points or a larger cut in the lower rate of employer NICs. Presumably, the
use of revenues from the landfill levy to reduce employment taxes is an application
of the \'double dividend\' arguments discussed earlier. However, this initiative must
largely be seen as cosmetic. Piecemeal changes are likely to have little impact overall
(particularly since in this case even a tax rate of £5 per tonne, approximately 50% of
current average landfill prices, will only lead to small reductions in NICs). Indeed,
this measure raises the question of why the Chancellor has decided to use revenues
from the landfill levy in this way when there would be much more scope to reduce
direct taxes by using the revenues from other \'green\' tax measures such as petrol taxes
or VAT on domestic fuel and heating. Furthermore, although reductions in NICs are
likely to be welcomed by industry across the board, the measure will not, in many
instances, be particularly beneficial to those industries likely to bear the largest burden
resulting from the tax since many of these (particularly steel-making and electricity
generation) tend to be capital-rather than labour-intensive.

Research Paper 96/103
Table 3 above shows the use of landfill in disposing of municipal waste across the OECD:
although the UK\'s geology and hydrology tend to favour landfill compared to other countries,
several other OECD states make extensive use of landfill as a disposal route. 12 of the 22
countries surveyed landfilled more than half of their municipal waste152 in the latest year for
which they have produced figures.
During the proceedings of the Finance Bill in January 1996, the then Paymaster General,
David Heathcoat-Amory, pointed out that several other countries operated a landfill tax:153
We are not alone in introducing such a tax. It already exists in Denmark,
the Netherlands, France and parts of Belgium and I understand that the
Italians are proposing to introduce such a tax. In general, the rates of those
taxes are above what we are proposing ... This is not an environmental
European tax. We have no desire to harmonise such tax rates throughout
the European Community. We are introducing it in this country because it
suits British conditions and it is good for the environment. Also, we can
relieve taxation on employment [by cutting the rate of employer\'s NICs].
Each of the countries with a landfill tax already in force (Belgium, Denmark, France and the
Netherlands) disposes of less than half of their municipal waste to landfill. Denmark has had
a landfill tax since 1986, which has increased from approximately £5 per tonne to a planned
£33 per tonne in 1997. The Netherlands has a landfill tax of around £12 per tonne, and
France a waste storage and industrial waste tax of £5154.
In Denmark particularly the introduction of a landfill tax, together with progressive increases
in its rate, has coincided with a marked decline in levels of waste sent to landfill. In 1985,
prior to the introduction of a tax, around 1.4 million tonnes of municipal waste, around 63%
of all municipal waste, was landfilled by Danish municipalities155. In 1993, only around 0.5
million tonnes of municipal waste went to landfill, around 20% of the total.
                                                                                                                                                                                            
152 Waste collected by municipalities. The figures in the table showing total waste generated are not a reliable
indicator of absolute levels of waste generation, since the waste responsibilities of municipalities will differ
between countries. The table does, however, offer a broad comparison of disposal routes.

B. European developments in landfill legislation
A draft Landfill Directive - 93/7506/EEC - was first proposed by the European Commission
in 1990. The UK\'s main objection concerned its proposed ban on co-disposal.156 The
Government was also concerned by the suggestion that all landfills should be routinely
monitored.157 Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg stated that they expected the
Directive\'s conditions to, in effect, bar landfill without pre-treatment to ensure that stable
residues only were landfilled for \'long-term safety\'.158 (The Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution in its report Incineration of Waste159 recommended pretreatment of
landfill waste by incineration to reduce the long term risks of pollution, greenhouse gas
production, risk of leaching, and volume of landfill by up to 90%.) 
In their contribution to the Royal Commission\'s report, Aspinwall & Co commented on the
likely effect of the Landfill Directive:160
"The siting of a landfill site is already a complicated process but it is bound to
become even more difficult in the future. The latest draft of the EC Landfill Directive
proposes to include restrictions in terms of proximity (not less than 5000 metres) to
roads, recreational areas, houses, waterways or agricultural sites. Clearly this doesn\'t
leave much room for new development ... The UK tradition of refilling voidspace left
by quarrying works may ease the impact of this new restriction, but in the long term
the consequence will be that landfills will become fewer, and subsequently more
valuable."
In May 1996 however, the European Parliament, on the recommendation of the Environment
Committee\'s rapporteur, rejected the common position on the draft Directive (445 votes to 18,
with 22 abstentions).161 MEPs felt that the Directive did not go far enough, in that it did not
ban an indefinite perpetuation of co-disposal. It also included the possibility of exempting
small landfills in mountainous or sparsely populated areas from control. This had been
inserted at the insistence of Ireland and Portugal and meant, said the rapporteur, that half the
land area of the Community might possibly be excluded from the scope of the Directive.162
Because the Council of Ministers had adopted its common position by qualified majority
rather than unanimity (France and Belgium wanted the Directive to go further) the
Parliament\'s vote effectively killed the Directive, as the rapporteur acknowledged, calling for

the Commission to table a revised draft \'respecting the views of MEPs\'.163 
At least eight Member States are reported to have recently introduced or to be considering
pretreatment of degradable waste prior to landfilling, and the Commission\'s draft waste
strategy published in early 1996 indicated support for this principle, which suggests that any
revised draft Directive would include such provisions.164 This is also the Government\'s view,
although it does not agree with it:165
"Recently, the United Kingdom\'s landfill policy has been discussed in the context of
the European Commission\'s communication on the review of the Community strategy
for waste management. The Commission\'s communication suggests that all waste
going to landfill should be pre-treated. There is no sound scientific basis to this
approach. Landfill when properly engineered and controlled is a viable waste
management option for a range of wastes.
The United Kingdom favours the disposal of untreated biodegradable waste to landfill,
and the use of the biochemical process engineering - bio-reactor - approach to manage
landfill sites. This approach is designed to prevent pollution caused by the
degradation process, and to provide conditions in the landfill in which stabilisation of
the waste in situ is as rapid as possible. The approach is based on research into
landfill practices that the [DoE] has sponsored for more than 20 years." 
The Commission is expected to publish a new proposal for a Directive \'in the next few
weeks\'. The UK has undertaken to oppose any provisions requiring the pre-treatment of all
waste going to landfill.166

October 1996
Research Paper 96/105
13 November 1996
Official monthly unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few
constituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper presents up-to-date
residence-based unemployment rates not published elsewhere for all 651 constituencies in the
UK, using figures for the number of unemployed claimants from the monthly count and data
for the economically active population from the 1991 Census of Population. 
In May 1996 the Office for National Statistics moved to a 1991 ward base for the
unemployment statistics. This means that for many constituencies it is no longer possible to
make direct comparisons with previously published data. As a result, this Paper no longer
includes a table on changes in the level of unemployment in recent years. Research Paper
96/63 provides a guide to the methodology and to which constituencies are affected by the
change in the geographical base.

Research Paper 96/105
I Introduction
Official monthly unemployment rates for parliamentary constituencies only exist for those few
constituencies which are self-contained labour markets. This paper presents up-to-date
unemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed
claimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active
derived from the 1991 Census of Population. 
These residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative
deprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand
for labour, as they take no account of people\'s ability to seek work outside the constituency
in which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see
the Research Paper 96/63.
The data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this
series of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS
changed the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly
figures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.
From the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of
frozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released
on the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For
many constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.
For this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number
of claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. 
Notes to tables:
1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The
following abbreviations for parties have been used:
CON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party
LAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party
LD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and
PC Plaid Cymru Labour Party
SNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party
SPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist
VAC Vacant seat

Research Paper 96/105
2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating
residence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the
Local Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and
Northern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as "Enumeration Districts".
These data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to
form constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to "Output Areas". These
figures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level
geographical areas such as constituencies and districts.
There is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being
incorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always
coterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted
to constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population
are thought to live. Those constituencies where such a process has been employed are
denoted "***" in all the tables in this paper.
3. There are two seats currently vacant: Barnsley East and Wirral South.

The aim of this Bill, which was presented on 15 November 1996, is to amend the law
governing the administration of social security to improve the prevention and detection of
benefit fraud and the efficiency with which benefits, in particular housing benefit and council
tax benefit, are administered by local authorities.
This paper gives background to the introduction of the Bill, including discussion on the extent
of benefit fraud and the success of existing initiatives. The paper also includes comment from
interested organisations on the Bill\'s provisions, although at the time of writing relatively few
of these bodies had prepared their responses. The Bill is due to be debated on Second
Reading on 25 November 1996.

Research Paper 96/107
I Summary
The Secretary of State for Social Security, Peter Lilley, announced at the Conservative Party
Conference on 9 October 1996 that measures would be introduced to help the Department of
Social Security (DSS) in its fight to combat benefit fraud. The Social Security Administration
(Fraud) Bill was presented on 15 November 1996 and is due to be debated on Second
Reading on 25 November 1996.
Benefit fraud is currently estimated to cost the taxpayer £3 billion a year. Various initiatives
have been introduced to detect and prevent fraud; the in-year detection target for 1996/97 is
£1.8 billion.1 The Government has stated that the first aim of this Bill is \'to ensure that fraud
investigators have the tools they need to catch those who cheat the benefit system and to
ensure that fraudsters pay\'.2 The Bill will:
 remove barriers to comparing information held on different databases for the purpose of
preventing, detecting and investigating fraud;
 introduce a range of penalties for claimants who give false information to get benefit;
 ensure that those who conceal information, as well as those who make false statements, can
be effectively prosecuted;
 make it easier to prosecute people who make fraudulent attempts to get a National
Insurance number.
The second stated aim of the Bill is to improve local authorities\' performance in the
administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. In this area the Bill will:
 enable the establishment of an inspectorate to monitor anti-fraud work in housing and
council tax benefits which are administered by local authorities;
 introduce powers to make directions to local authorities to improve their performance in
tackling housing benefit fraud.
Parts II and III of this paper give general background on benefit fraud (housing benefit fraud
is dealt with separately); part III sets out the Bill\'s provisions in detail and includes comment
from interested organisations.

II Social Security fraud in general
A. The extent of fraud and anti-fraud initiatives
The extent of social security fraud is estimated to be around £4 billion in the current year, of
which around £1 billion is detected.3
Research carried out by the Benefits Agency suggests fraudulent claims of income
support/unemployment benefit, housing and council tax benefits account for the bulk of fraud
activity. Evidence from surveys suggests around £1.5 billion is being overpaid in income
support and unemployment benefit (often associated with failure to declare income, capital
or changes in status such as living together as husband and wife).4 A further £1 billion is
reckoned to be being overpaid in housing benefit.5
In July 1995 the Secretary of State for Social Security announced a five-year strategy to give
more emphasis to the prevention and deterrence of fraud and error. This aims to increase the
security of the benefit process by:
 increasing control at the point of entry to the benefit system;
 improving control throughout the life of benefit claims;
 improving security and control at the point of benefit payment; and
 minimising weaknesses in the design of benefits.
In 1995/6 detected fraud savings amounted to £1.4 billion. £716 million in benefit fraud was
stopped by over 400,000 investigations and £507 million was saved through initiatives such
as data matching, bar-coding and scanning of order books, extra visits and checks on new and
existing claims. Benefit fraud stopped by local authorities accounts for the remaining
£222 million.6

Security and Control Programme savings.
Projects implemented in the first year of the strategy to reduce weakness and risks in the
benefit system include:
 New claim visits. Since July 1995 benefit claimants have been visited prior to award to
verify their circumstances.
 Targeted reviews. Verification of customer circumstances during the life of benefit
claims.
 Generalised matching. This compares internal Benefits Agency (BA) data to identify
inconsistencies in information held on benefit claims.
 Benefit reviews. Undertaking sample surveys to determine the scale of fraud and error and
establish the pattern of fraudulent activity.

Research Paper 96/107
 Electronic stop notice. Post Offices fitted with a scanner to read the bar code on benefit
order books can check the status of books prior to encashment. This prevents encashment
from reported lost or stolen books.
Other security measures and anti-fraud activities implemented include:
 The fraud referral hotline. This was piloted in a number of areas and enables the public
to pass on information about alleged benefit fraud; it was launched nationally in August
1996.
 Post Office rewards scheme. This rewards Post Office staff who prevent encashment of
fraudulent instruments of payment.
Measures to be implemented during the current financial year include:
 Further data matching (the current bill provides for more inter-departmental matching).
 More Benefit Reviews (to ascertain the nature and scale of fraud) so far research has been
published to estimate the scale of fraud in income support and unemployment benefit,
housing benefit and invalid care allowance.
 Increase in visits and reviews of claims.
 Introduction of benefit payment card (full implementation in 2-3 years).
 Action to tackle employers who collude with employees who work while continuing to
claim unemployment benefits.7

B. Types of fraud
Benefit fraud occurs in four main areas:
 Misrepresentation of household circumstances - either through incorrectly notifying the
BA at the point of claim or failing to notify during the period of the claim.
 Misrepresentation of financial circumstances - either through incorrectly notifying the
BA at the point of claim or failing to notify during the period of the claim.
 Identity - where claimants are not who they say they are and are not in fact entitled.
 Security of payments - When instruments of payment (order books and girocheques) are
stolen, manipulated or counterfeited to obtain payments to which there is no entitlement.
According to the Benefits Agency, fraud investigation work suggests the great majority of
fraud occurs through misrepresentation of household or financial circumstances.8

Expenditure on Housing Benefit (HB) has doubled in real terms since 1988; projected
expenditure for 1996/97 is £11 billion. The table below illustrates the growth in the cost of

The number of HB recipients living in local authority accommodation has remained fairly
constant while the numbers of private tenants, including housing association tenants, receiving
HB has risen dramatically;10 expenditure on HB in the private rented sector has increased by
350 per cent since 1988.
In January 1996 the Department of Social Security (DSS) published the findings of research
into the extent of error and fraud in HB payments. The report11 estimated that the total annual

Research Paper 96/107
value of HB lost as a result of error or fraud could exceed £1 billion; of this total it was
estimated that fraud would account for over £900 million. The Social Security Select
Committee\'s report, Housing Benefit Fraud, which was published in May 1996,12 is critical
of this estimate because of the methodology employed by the DSS:13
\'Much more serious than the failure to detect these individual frauds is the Report\'s almost complete absence
of evidence on organised or collusive frauds, particularly landlord fraud. This absence of evidence can be
partly explained by the passive nature of the exercise, based on checking existing information rather than on
investigation. The difference between checking information and investigating fraud is fundamental but the
awareness of this difference is not widely understood, let alone acted upon. The Committee has been told that
if investigative techniques are used a high level of fraud is detected in the private rented sector.\'
The Committee concluded that the true total of HB fraud could possibly be as high as £2
billion14 but the Government has rejected this suggestion:15
\'The Housing Benefit Review was a carefully planned, statistically sound study which involved unannounced
visits to claimants in their homes by trained fraud investigators. Its design was endorsed by the National Audit
Office. The Review estimated the scale of Housing Benefit fraud to be of the order of £1 billion. No other
study has ever been carried out in this country with a similarly rigorous methodology. The Government is
sceptical, therefore, about the view of the Local Authority Investigation Officers Group expressed to the
Committee that Housing Benefit fraud could amount to £2 billion, and notes that no supporting evidence was
provided for it.\'
On 14 November 1996 the Audit Commission published an update to its report Protecting the
Public Purse: Ensuring Probity in Local Government16 in which it states that \'[housing]
benefit fraud continues to be the major probity issue facing local government.\'17 It found that
there were 162,000 proven fraudulent cases in 1995/96 involving losses of £55 million; this
represented over 5 times as many detections as there were five years before.
Following the Government\'s announcement of its intention to bring forward a Bill to combat
social security fraud during the Queen\'s Speech on 23 October 1996, the London Housing
Unit (LHU) issued a Press Release in which it laid the blame for the increase in HB fraud at
the Government\'s feet:18

Research Paper 96/107
\'The high level of rents has made fraud a much more lucrative proposition for unscrupulous private landlords.
They were able to make claims for housing benefit for tenants who did not exist and for dwellings that were
unoccupied.
Lettings in the private sector were far more vulnerable to fraud than those in the public sector ... In the case
of council housing, the local authority is able to check immediately from its other records who is occupying
a property. According to LHU research, the cost of housing benefit to the Exchequer is now running at four
times the level it was in 1988, the last year before private sector rents were deregulated by the Government. 
LHU analysis shows that barely one pound in every four of this increase [in housing benefit expenditure] is
due to a rise in the number of privately rented properties for which housing benefit is paid. The great bulk
of the increase comes purely from an increase in rents.\'
B. Types of fraud
Studies into HB fraud have noted that it can be committed in a variety of different ways; the
list below, taken from the Social Security Select Committee\'s report,19 illustrates the many
ways in which HB fraud can be perpetrated:
Property based fraud:
Residence:
 claimant not resident at given address
 failure to report change of address
 claimant only resident long enough to set up claim (this may involve redirection of mail)
 sub-letting and moving on
Rent/tenancy:
 overstating rent payable (either individually by the tenant or collusive inflation of rent so
landlord and tenant split the proceeds
 fictitious sub-tenancy
 landlord is fictitious
 home owner is purporting to be tenant (at own home or another address)
                                                                                                                                                                                            
19 HC 90-I 1995-96 para 52
12


Research Paper 96/107
 landlord is a close relative
Multiple:
 claims for benefit by claimant using multiple identities
 claims for benefit by claimant using multiple addresses
Landlord:
 fictitious tenancy (claim for benefit where no tenancy exists)
 confirmation by landlord that tenant still in residence even though he has moved out
 claims for empty properties
 abuse of right to buy scheme with the property being bought then setting up tenancies with
original tenants as private tenants
Agents:
 agents with no legal standing (ie not authorised by the owner) increaseing rent levels or
number of tenants
Large scale organised fraud:
 of various types including where a business or family own a number of properties and
move \'tenants\' in and out with such regularity that tracing becomes impossible. Properties
may be registered under false names to confuse investigators. \'Tenants\' may be employees
or family members collusively claiming in many different places.
Income based fraud:
Working:
 working whilst stating unemployed or sick/disabled
 having two jobs but declaring one
 working under a false name and claiming under another
Declaration:
 understating earnings
13


Research Paper 96/107
 stating basic earnings but not overtime, bonus or commission 
 working shortened hours, or going sick for purpose of declaration, then return to normal
 failure to declare partner\'s earnings
Collusion:
 by employers understating hours, rates of pay or allowing job to be completely undeclared
 by wages staff giving false wage slips or declaration
Capital and possessions:
 non-declaration or understating of investments, capital or pensions
 false bank accounts
 self-employed showing false or manipulated accounts
 failing to disclose ownership or rental income from other property
Circumstance based fraud:
Marital:
 failure to declare relationship
 fictitious desertion
 duplicate claims ie each partner claiming full rent
 partners jointly purchasing property, then one claiming to be the landlord and the other the
tenant
Declarations:
 failure to declare non-dependents, lodgers, sub-tenants, family members
 fictitious children
 false declarations of age, disability to attract premium
14


Research Paper 96/107
Instrument of payment fraud:
False encashment:
 cheques falsely stated as lost or not received - duplicate and originals cashed
 cheques altered
 interception of mail
 forgery of cheques
 false identity use to cash cheques
Internal frauds:
 false claims created by staff
 multiple false claims
 theft of blank cheques
 manipulation of claims for third parties
 manipulation of computer to create advantage
 false declarations recorded
C. Anti-fraud initiatives
HB has been administered by local authorities on behalf of the DSS since 1983. As with all
benefits, an important objective of the delivery system is to ensure that all those entitled to
a benefit receive the correct amount; local authorities have a statutory responsibility to ensure
that their systems do their best to meet this objective. The Social Security Select Committee\'s
1996 report commented that: \'During the 1980s there appears to have been little coherent
strategy to prevent, deter or detect Housing Benefit fraud\'.20 In practice, until 1993 the
subsidy system in operation penalised authorities for detecting fraud as these payments were
treated as overpayments which attracted a lower rate of subsidy. Recent years have seen
concerted efforts by central and local government to combat fraud.

Research Paper 96/107
1. Financial incentives
By way of an incentive to authorities to be vigilant in regard to potentially fraudulent claims
the DSS introduced a scheme in April 1993 whereby authorities could share in any savings
achieved above and beyond their share of a national baseline (originally set at £100 million
and increased to £150 million from April 1996).21 These incentives were strengthened in
April 199622 so that authorities can now receive 10 per cent additional subsidy on savings
above three quarters of their share of the national threshold and 25 per cent (previously 20
per cent) on savings achieved in excess of their share of the national threshold. The threshold
is distributed according to each local authority\'s share of national HB/Council Tax Benefit
(CTB) expenditure.
In April 1994 subsidy reductions were introduced for authorities achieving less than 50 per
cent of the £100 million threshold in order to encourage those who were perceived as doing
little to combat fraud. In 1993/94 local authorities saved around £90 million; this increased
to £171 million in 1994/95 and £222 million in 1995/96. In the last financial year around 90
per cent of authorities (421) received bonus payments as a direct result of their efforts to curb
fraud;23 a total of £28 million in extra subsidy was earned in 1995/96 as a result of the
incentive scheme.24
The introduction of the incentive scheme was generally welcomed by local authorities. In
January 1995 the DSS published an analysis of the operation of the scheme25 the main
findings of which are summarised in the Social Security Committee\'s Report as follows:26
 the proportion of authorities with no fraud staff in place had decreased from 28 per cent
to four per cent since the implementation of the scheme in April 1993;
 80 per cent of local authorities expected to better their performance in the second year of
the scheme compared to the first year;
 the majority of authorities (77 per cent) agreed that in dividing up the national baseline,
the level of benefit expenditure should be used while a similar proportion (79 per cent)
thought that such data should be weighted to reflect factors that varied between authorities;
 there was evidence of different methods being used to calculate benefit savings;
                                                                                                                                                                                            
21 This initiative was referred to as \'Action Against Fraud\'.

 there was widespread agreement that the formula took no account of preventive or deterrent
work.
2. National register
Following publication of the Housing Benefit Review in January 1996 the Secretary of State
for Social Security, Peter Lilley, announced the creation of a national register of Housing
Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (to be operational from July 1996) with a view to matching
data across local authorities against departmental fraud detection systems:27
\'There are currently 475 local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland. They administer Housing Benefit and
Council Tax Benefit individually on different, unconnected IT systems with no interface with Benefits Agency
IT systems. The Central Register will provide comparison of information, detection of inconsistencies and
identification of fraud. It will be able to match data within and across local authorities and against DSS systems
to detect fraud and inconsistencies.\'
3. Challenge funding
This initiative, also announced in response to the Housing Benefit Review - Main Stage
Report, has involved making up to £10 million available from April 1996 \'to enable local
authorities to develop innovative ideas to tackle fraud\'.28 Authorities may bid for funds with
which to implement new schemes; successful schemes are to be publicised to encourage
adoption by other authorities. The finance for this scheme has been re-directed from local
authorities\' administration grants.
4. Audit Commission
In January 1996 the Secretary of State announced that the Government intended to work
closely with the Audit Commission to tighten up local authority methods of preventing
fraudulent claims getting into the system.29 
The Audit Commission\'s auditors have been working with local government in London to
develop computer techniques for detecting fraud. Its 1996 report30 notes that the London

Team Against Fraud detected fraud worth £3 million using these techniques in 1995/96; by
1997 it aims to extend these techniques to all councils in England and Wales as part of the
National Fraud Initiative (NFI). 
The Commission is carrying out a joint study into HB with the National Audit Office (NAO)
which is designed to review the arrangements to deter, identify and investigate fraud. The
NAO is to report to Parliament on the effectiveness of the DSS\'s measures to encourage local
authorities to combat fraud, including subsidy incentives and anti-fraud training. The
Commission intends to publish a report and handbook describing best practice, aimed at those
in local government who administer HB.31
The Audit Commission is also participating in a joint study with the Benefits Agency on co-
operation between the Agency and local authorities in preventing and detecting fraud. The
Commission is involved in the formation of the London Organised Fraud Investigation (see
below).
5. Fraud teams
As concern about HB fraud grew during the 1990s a number of local authorities developed
some local initiatives. In 1993 the Finance Directors of London Boroughs formed the London
Committee for Action Against Fraud which funds the London Team Against Fraud. In 1994
this Team set up a Housing Benefit Central Register to match HB data across 33 London
Boroughs. In 1991 local authority fraud investigators formed a national group, the Local
Authority Investigation Officers Group. A separate group, the London Boroughs Fraud
Investigators Group was formed in London. The aim of these groups is to raise the profile
of local authority fraud issues and provide training and support to their members.
In May 1996 the Social Security Fraud Minister, Oliver Heald, announced the creation of the
London Fraud Investigation Team (LOFIT) comprising six specialist teams of up to 20 local
authority investigation officers. LOFIT is to focus on:32
 organised HB fraud conducted across more than one London borough;
 liaison with the Benefits Agency, Police, Crown Prosecution Service, London Team
Against Fraud and other relevant organisations;
 landlord surveillance;

 promotion of good practice in preventing and detecting fraud.
6. Response to the Social Security Select Committee\'s Report
In response to the Committee\'s May 1996 report Peter Lilley announced three new anti-fraud
measures including:33
 The setting up of a cross-governmental committee to formalise the co-ordination of
measures to tackle fraud;
 The relaxation of restrictions on the sharing of information between the Inland Revenue
and DSS officials for the purpose of identifying potential fraud;
 Discussions to take place with the Royal Mail over access to the database of redirected
mail to assist in tackling multiple identity and other frauds involving false addresses.
III The Bill and detailed comment
A. Supply and use of information (Clauses 1-4)
The general aim of these clauses (1-4) is to improve the detection of certain types of benefit
fraud by allowing data provided to certain government departments to be compared with data
held by the DSS in order to identify inconsistencies. Local authorities will be allowed to
exchange and pass on data to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud and to promote
the efficient administration of HB and council tax benefit (CTB).
Provisions for the exchange of information between government departments for social
security purposes are currently covered by section 122 of the Social Security Administration
Act 1992 and section 116 of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.
These relate solely to information held by the Inland Revenue. They state that any obligation
of secrecy on the part of the Inland Revenue cannot prevent the disclosure of information held
in connection with the assessment or collection of income tax to officials of the DSS. The
information must be in connection with the collection and assessment of national insurance
contributions. Once information is disclosed to the DSS, the department is as bound as the
Inland Revenue not to disclose that information further, unless it is to be made available for

the purposes of civil or criminal proceedings in relation to contribution law, the Jobseekers
Act 1995 or the determination of a question by the Secretary of State.
There is currently no provision to enable information held by Customs and Excise to be
disclosed to the DSS. However, as the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise are
authorised to disclose to each other information which is relevant to the other\'s duties it has
been suggested that some information which is passed to the DSS by the Inland Revenue
could have originated from Customs and Excise34.
For self employed people paying schedule D tax, the information that can be disclosed to the
DSS is restricted to that which is sufficient to identify the person undertaking the work,
details of when that person commences or ceases self employed work and to certain
circumstances when the responsibility for the assessment of Class 4 contributions has passed
from the Inland Revenue to the DSS.
The department has been developing its investigative methods for detecting fraud with an
increased use of information technology. The Generalised Matching Service (GMS) has been
in operation since April 1995. It takes benefit data from internal Benefit Agency computers
and matches that information against specific rules to identify inconsistencies. In this way
the system generates referrals for fraud officers to investigate and according to department
figures has led to £29m in savings in 1995/635. There have also been attempts to extend the
working cooperation between government departments with regard to the disclosure of
information36.
Clause 1 of the Bill will replace section 122 of the 1992 Act and proposes to extend the
provision for the disclosure of information. The Bill stipulates that information held by the
Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise may be passed to the DSS:
\'for use in the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences relating to
social security;
or
for use in checking the accuracy of information.\'
This is more directive than the 1992 Act which merely states that the passing of certain
information cannot be prevented. Under the Bill\'s proposals as long as it can be used for the
above, there are no restrictions on the information which can be disclosed.

Research Paper 96/107
The new Section 122(3)(c) will allow for information passed on from the Inland Revenue and
Customs and Excise to be disclosed further to local authorities for the purpose of detecting
and preventing council tax benefit or housing benefit fraud. The calculation of CTB and HB
is partly dependent on the level of social security benefits to which a claimant is entitled.
The new Section 122A will allow information held by the Inland Revenue to be disclosed to
the Contributions Agency and re-enacts existing provisions. The Contributions Agency is the
arm of the DSS which maintains and checks people\'s National Insurance contribution records.
However, unlike information passed from the Inland Revenue to the DSS, it was not thought
necessary to allow for this to be disclosed further to local authorities and this is not provided
for.
Clause 2 extends the provisions to include information held by people working for other
Government departments. Subsection (1)(a) covers information which relates to "passports,
immigration and emigration, nationality or prisoners" and would allow for this to be given to
the DSS for the same purposes as outlined for Inland Revenue information above. A
claimant\'s immigration status and nationality can affect their entitlement to benefits as this can
be dependent on residence or immigration-status. The Bill would allow DSS officials to
check the information received from a claimant with that held about them by the immigration
authorities.
Concern about prisoners stems largely from people failing to inform the authorities when they
have gone into custody and their claim for benefits has fraudulently continued. This issue
was raised in a parliamentary question in 1994 and Alistair Burt, then Parliamentary Under
Secretary of State for Social Security, outlined the measures that were being newly undertaken
at that time to combat this type of fraud:37
In response to the continuing problem of benefit fraud amongst prisoners new controls were introduced on 4
March. The Prison Service now provides the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service with a weekly
list of all newly convicted prisoners in England and Wales. This will ensure that all benefit recipients have
their case reviewed on entry to prison.
The provisions in the Bill would extend these controls to cover all prisoners including those
on remand.
Subsection (b) covers information which relates to "any other matter prescribed". This
effectively means regulations could be laid which would allow for any Government
                                                                                                                                                                                            
37 HC Deb 16 March 1994 c.709W

Research Paper 96/107
department to be covered by these provisions. The definition of Government departments for
the purposes of this Bill is:
\'a person providing services to a Minister of the Crown or a government department
(including a Northern Ireland department)\'
Thus, anyone who comes under this definition could in the future come under the terms of
the Bill and be required to pass information to the DSS which could assist in preventing or
detecting benefit fraud. This information could then be disclosed further to local authorities
to help with the detection of CTB or HB. Similar provisions are included in the Bill to cover
the use of other government information in Northern Ireland to be made available to the DSS.
The Government believes the new rules will remove unnecessary barriers to the effective
detection and prevention of social security fraud.
Whilst recognising the need to ensure benefit fraud is tackled effectively some respondents
to the Bill feel that the increased powers it would provide need to be balanced by safeguards
to protect people\'s privacy. Justice, a campaign group for human rights and legal reform,
believe the Data Protection Act would provide inadequate protection and advocates a
statutory code of practice relating to data matching between government departments.
Clause 3 adds a new section (122C) to the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to allow
the Secretary of State or the Northern Ireland (NI) Department to supply information relating
to HB or CTB to local authorities for use in the administration of those benefits and requires
authorities to have regard to this information when administering them. 
As clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill provide for the supply of information held by tax authorities
and other government departments to the Secretary of State or the NI Department, the effect
of clause 3 is to enable this information to be supplied to local authorities for use in the
prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences relating to HB or CTB, or to
check the accuracy of information relating to HB/CTB claims. 
The clause allows the Secretary of State or NI Department to impose conditions on the use
of such information and to charge a fee for supplying it. Further disclosure of the information
is to be prevented except in certain limited circumstances.
Additionally, clause 3 inserts a new section (122D) into the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary
of State or NI Department to require local authorities, and other bodies authorised to exercise
22


Research Paper 96/107
the HB/CTB functions of an authority, to supply information relating to benefit administration
or policy to the Secretary of State or NI Department. The manner and form of information
supplied under this section may be prescribed.
Clause 3 also inserts a new section (122E) into the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary of State
and NI Department to authorise local authorities to supply information relating to benefit
administration to other authorities for use in the prevention, detection, investigation or
prosecution of offences relating to HB/CTB or for maintaining and improving the accuracy
of information relating to those benefits.
Clause 4 extends the provisions in Schedule 4 to the 1992 Act that set out who may commit
the offence of unauthorised disclosure of social security information to cover local authority
members, officers and employees, local authority contractors and their employees, local
authority inspectors and local government ombudsmen and auditors.
B. Administration of HB and CTB (Clauses 5-10)
Clause 5 inserts a new section (139A) in the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary of State to
authorise persons to consider and report to him on the administration of HB and CTB by local
authorities with particular reference to the prevention and detection of fraud. These
\'authorised persons\' will have rights of access, at any reasonable time, to any documents and
information relating to the administration of benefits. They will also be entitled to an
explanation from any person accountable for documents, or involved in benefits
administration, and to require it to be given in person. Any person who fails, without
reasonable excuse, to comply with such a requirement imposed by an authorised person will
be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on
the standard scale(£1,000).
A report to the Secretary of State made under this section by an authorised person may
include recommendations about improvements that could be made by an authority in terms
of benefit administration, with particular regard to the prevention and detection of fraud.
Local authorities will receive copies of these reports as and when they are sent to the
Secretary of State.
The effect of clause 5 will be to give power to a national inspectorate to monitor anti-fraud
work by local authorities. An inspectorate could be set up under existing social security
legislation but it would lack the powers that the Bill is seeking to introduce. 
23


Research Paper 96/107
The local authority associations have questioned the need for such an inspectorate on the
grounds that only 27 out of 400 authorities were below their fraud targets in 1995/96; Paul
Lautman of the Association of District Councils (ADC) has been reported as stating:38
\'It\'s using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, the DSS has already got sufficient means to penalise poor
performance. We would have thought there were better ways to invest than in a costly inspectorate.\'
The associations are concerned about what they perceive as the \'big brother\' approach of
developing an inspectorate with extensive powers; Paul Lautman has commented that local
authorities are responsible bodies and that the rationale for a fraud inspectorate is none too
clear.39 Speaking on behalf of the joint associations Paul Jenks, Chair of the ADC Housing
Committee, stated:40
\'Local authorities share the Government\'s concern about benefit fraud and have made great efforts to tackle
it. But we are concerned that the powers of this new fraud inspectorate are excessive and unnecessary - the
money would be better spent recruiting local authority fraud investigators to work at the sharp end to combat
fraud and to ensure that benefit reaches those who are entitled to receive it.\'
Clause 6 inserts a new section into the Local Government and Finance Act 1982 to enable
the Audit Commission to assist the Secretary of State, on request, in any study designed to
improve the administration of HB/CTB by local authorities. Under this provision authorities
and their officers will be obliged to provide information needed for the conduct of such a
study. The clause also provides for the exchange of information between the Secretary of
State and the Audit Commission.
Clause 7 makes similar provision in relation to the Commission for Local Authority Accounts
in Scotland.
Clause 8 inserts a new section into the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (139D) to
enable the Secretary of State to invite a local authority to consider a report made about its
administration of HB or CTB and to remedy any failing identified in it. The clause allows
the Secretary of State to make directions about the standards which an authority is expected
to attain and the time within which they are to be attained. The Secretary of State will have
the power to make recommendations about the courses of action that the authority might take
to achieve these standards.

Research Paper 96/107
Clause 9 amends section 140B of the 1992 Act, which provides for the calculation of
subsidy in respect of HB and CTB, to strengthen the Secretary of State\'s powers to increase
or decrease the subsidy paid to local authorities on the basis of their success or failure in
preventing and detecting fraud. The manner in which these deductions/increases are to be
calculated will be specified by Order. The Secretary of State will also be able to deduct
subsidy if an authority fails to reach the standards that he has directed them to attain under
section 139D (see clause 8).
The local authority associations argued against the introduction of an increased detection
target for HB/CTB fraud and associated subsidy cuts from April 1 1996.41 There was concern
that many councils would find it difficult to achieve the fraud savings targets set; Paul
Lautman of the ADC has made the following response:42
\'The DSS needs to recognise the need to invest to save. That means up front investment in investigating
officers. Councils have already expressed concern that the harsher incentive regime will throw their budgets
into turmoil.\'
The local authority associations are, therefore, opposed to this provision in the Bill which
implies further adjustments in subsidy entitlement. They have called for councils to be given
\'a period of stability\', and have said that the government is \'tinkering\' without waiting to see
how far this year\'s targets are working.43
Clause 10 inserts a new section 110 into the 1992 Act to allow local authorities administering
HB/CTB to appoint inspectors from among their employees or, with the consent of the
Secretary of State, the employees of another authority or, from among employees of a
contractor acting on its behalf. An appointed inspector will be able to enter business premises
to make enquiries about any person believed to be a benefit claimant or recipient. Private
dwelling houses will not be liable to inspection unless there are reasonable grounds for
believing that a trade or business is being carried on from there which is not also being
carried on from premises other than the dwelling house in question. The clause places a duty
on the following classes of person to supply information or produce documents if required by
an appointed inspector:
(a) persons who occupy premises liable to inspection or persons found by an inspector in
any such premises;
(b) persons believed by an inspector to be benefit claimants or benefit recipients;

(c) persons believed by an inspector to hold or have access to information or documents
relating to a person in (b) above; or
(d) persons who are employees or agents of a person within any of the paragraphs (a) to
(c) above.
In regard to clauses 8, 9 and 10 CHAR, the housing campaign for single people, has made
the following response:44
 If increasing amounts of time and resources are directed towards tackling fraud then the
efficiency of of other aspects of the HB system, eg calculation and payment of HB, are
likely to suffer. We fear that late payments could result, causing problems for claimants
and landlords.
 If financial penalties and incentives are to be used to encourage local authorities to tackle
fraud then we feel similar arrangements should be made to make them tackle the problem
of late payments of benefit.
 We are concerned that the subsidy penalties could also cause over-zealous and cash-
strapped local authorities to victimise innocent people.
 If local authorities are constantly on the look out for fraud the culture of suspicion that
could arise in benefit offices could lead to large delays in the processing of HB claims and
claimants being subjected to excessive scrutiny prior to their being paid their HB.
C. Offences, penalties and overpayments (Clauses 11-14)
Currently, a person attempting to obtain benefit45 is guilty of an offence if he:
 makes a statement or representation which he knows to be false;
 provides documents or information which he knows to be false;
 knowingly causes or allows another person to provide documents or information which he
knows to be false.46

45 Benefits covered by S.110 of the SSAA 1992
46 Section 112 Social Security Administration Act 1992
26


Research Paper 96/107
Such an offence carries a maximum fine of £5,000 (level 5 on the standard scale), or
imprisonment for up to 3 months, or both. In addition, a person may have to repay any
benefit overpaid as a result. This offence is liable for summary conviction only - this means
it can be tried only in a magistrates  court (in Scotland, a Sheriffs  court).
Clause 11 creates a new, more serious, offence, where a person dishonestly makes a false
statement or provides false information or causes another person to do this to gain benefit or
other advantage under social security legislation. It also makes an offence of failure to notify,
or causing another person to fail to notify, certain changes of circumstances. These changes
will be prescribed in regulations.
Such an offence will be triable either summarily (in a magistrates  court) or on indictment
(in a higher court). A summary conviction can have a fine of up to the statutory maximum,
(currently £5,000) or imprisonment up to six months, or both. On conviction on indictment,
the maximum term of imprisonment is seven years, or a fine, or both.
This offence is intended to cover more serious fraudulent offences than the existing section
112. In England and Wales it will require a person to have acted “dishonestly”, not just
“knowingly”. In Scotland it will be sufficient for a person to have knowingly made
representations to obtain benefit for an offence under the new section to have been committed.
The reason for the different wording in England and Wales compared with Scotland is
apparently to allow for differences in the two jurisdictions and the DSS intention is that they
should have the same effect.
Clause 12 extends the summary offence of obtaining benefit by false representation. A
person who makes a statement or representation which he knows to be false is guilty of an
offence. The clause strengthens this provision and a person who without "reasonable excuse"
fails to report a change of circumstances or causes or allows another person to do so will be
guilty of an offence. This means that it will be an offence to fail to notify a change in
circumstances or knowingly cause or allow another person to do so. The changes in
circumstances covered by this provision will be contained in regulations. 
Where overpayment of benefit has occurred, generally, a person has to have misrepresented
or failed to disclose a material fact for repayment to be required.47 Failure to disclose a fact
would include not telling the Benefits Agency of relevant changes in circumstances. There
is currently no specific offence of failing to notify a change in circumstances - generally the
                                                                                                                                                                                            
47 Section 71(1) SSAA 1992 
27


Research Paper 96/107
Benefits Agency relies on the wider failure to disclose and sometimes on the
misrepresentation provisions to encompass such individuals. Prosecutions of those suspected
of benefit fraud are used in a very small proportion of cases. While court action is rare, in
many cases action the Benefits Agency attempts to recover money overpaid as benefits. This
can be done by stopping payment of the same or most other benefits or by enforcement
proceedings in the county courts. Where recovery is through stopping Income Support, the
maximum which can be deducted from weekly benefit is £9.60 if a person has admitted fraud
or been found guilty of fraud or £7.20 in any other case.
Clause 13 provides for a 30% penalty payment to be made in addition to an overpayment as
an alternative to court action. This will apply to overpayments of centrally administered
benefits and housing and council tax benefit. The imposition of a penalty payment will only
be allowed where it appears that the overpayment is attributable to an act or omission on the
part of an individual and there are grounds for instituting proceedings for an offence in
relation to the overpayment. Following written notice by the Secretary of State a person can
agree to pay the penalty in the same way as overpayments are recouped. No proceedings
relating to the overpayment will be instituted against a person agreeing to pay the 30%
penalty.
According to the DSS, the rate of penalty needs to reflect a level that is high enough to be
seen as punitive without being set too high so as to provide a disincentive to accepting the
penalty. The level chosen is comparable to fines imposed by other government departments
when the differing client groups are taken into consideration.
Estimates accompanying the Bill reckon there will be around 25,000 overpayment penalty
cases each year of which 5,000 will involve local authorities. For the DSS extra costs are
estimated at around £3 million per year with anticipated savings of £3.9 million. For local
authorities the extra costs will be around £800,000 with up to £1 million collected in
penalties.
Clause 14 amends section 75 of the 1992 Act, which provides for the recovery of
overpayments of HB, to allow local authorities to recover HB overpayments from payments
made directly to a landlord or his agent in respect of other tenants where, for example, the
original tenant, in respect of whom the overpayment arose, has vacated the landlord\'s property.
Payments subject to a deduction in this way will still discharge the liability of the other tenant
to the landlord. 
Where overpayments are not recovered by deductions from benefits the clause provides for
their recovery by action in the county court in England and Wales and in the sheriff\'s court
in Scotland. This measure will align HB with other social security benefits by allowing a HB
28


Research Paper 96/107
overpayment determination to be treated as a proof of debt which can then be registered as
a court order.
The local authority associations have welcomed this extension to their powers to recover
benefit overpayments but are disappointed that the Bill will not go further to require the
registration of landlords owning more than 20 homes in respect of which HB is payable, and
to allow the refusal of HB payments where they are not allowed to inspect properties.48
Specific measures that the associations would like to see introduced include:49
 a requirement on letting agents to give local councils the name of an owner of a property;
 a power to cease a claim if refused entry to a property;
 a requirement for a register of all landlords who own more than 20 properties.
The London Housing Unit, which believes that the main cause of the growth in HB fraud is
the ability of private landlords to make uncontrolled rent increases,50 has urged the
Government to put more emphasis on the targeting of these landlords.51
The Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) is concerned that landlords will have
no automatic right of appeal over the recovery of benefit in this manner and has issued the
following response to clause 14:52
\'Such arbitrary, tribunal-style justice will cause respectable landlords and their agents to turn away all Housing
Benefit tenants and leave the housing of such tenants to the unscrupulous who often offer the poorest quality
accommodation.
This will help to defeat the government\'s avowed intention of enlisting the private rented sector to make up
the shortfall in housing association and local authority housing.\'
CHAR, the housing campaign for single people, is of the view that clause 14 could exacerbate
problems which already occur where overpayments of benefit are recovered from landlords
who cannot recover the money from the tenants concerned because they have moved on.
CHAR\'s response to the Bill makes the following points:53

Research Paper 96/107
 Many accommodation providers could find themselves with cash-flow problems if their
rental income was reduced. Those most likely to suffer are small housing associations, the
many hostels with few resources, and private sector landlords who rely on rent to pay the
mortgage on the property they rent out.
 Other tenants whose HB is being used to make up the overpayment could be affected.
Although this is not the government\'s intention, it is possible that landlords will still expect
other tenants to cover their rents - failure to do so could result in harassment or the
eventual loss of their deposit when they leave the property.
 The widespread discrimination against claimants in the private rented sector will be
exacerbated by this part of the Bill. One of the major reasons for the current bias is that
HB problems, ie shortfalls and delayed payments, lead the majority of landlords to seek
to let to those in work. This change will provide another deterrent to letting to people on
benefits. It is particularly worrying as it will have the greatest effect on those landlords
who have more than one tenant on benefit.
D. Reviews and medical examinations (Clauses 15-16)
Disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance are benefits available to severely
disabled people. The present benefit structure dates back to April 1992 when mobility and
attendance allowances for people under 65 were replaced by DLA. This is one benefit with
separate components for care and mobility. Attendance allowance remains to meet the care
needs of those 65 and over. Currently, awards of DLA and attendance allowance can be
made for a limited period (with a minimum of 6 months) or for life. Recipients of
DLA/attendance allowance can apply for their awards to be reviewed and it could be
advantageous for them to do so if, for example, their condition has worsened to the extent
they would be entitled to a higher rate. An adjudication officer can initiate a review of a case
where there has been ignorance of a material fact, or a mistake, or a change in circumstances.
Disability working allowance is a tax-free benefit to top-up the earnings of low-paid workers
with a disability. Like family credit, it is paid for 26 weeks, usually regardless of changes
in circumstances.
Clause 15 enables the Secretary of State to initiate a review of these benefits and carry out
investigations to obtain information for that review. It confirms that the Secretary of State
may initiate a review of benefit during the course of the current benefit award. The need to
clarify the law on this point arises because existing provisions allow benefit reviews to be
30


Research Paper 96/107
initiated "on an application". It has been questioned who can make such an application.54
This clause makes it clear that, in addition to the claimant, the Secretary of State can review
benefit entitlement during the course of an award and that he can undertake investigations to
obtain evidence to support such a review.
These provisions are estimated to cost about £1 million annually, but lead to savings of
around £3 million.55
Clause 16 gives regulatory powers to the Secretary of State to require existing recipients of
disability living allowance and attendance allowance to undergo a medical examination. It
also provides for payment of benefit to be withheld if a person fails to attend a medical
examination. If benefit entitlement is subsequently confirmed, the clause further allows for
any withheld benefit to be paid.
Currently such powers only exist when an initial claim is being determined.56 Where an
award has already been made and it is alleged that the person should not or no longer be
entitled to benefit there is no power to require a person to undergo a medical examination.
The clause enables regulations to provide such powers.
Schedule 1 para 2 amends the Social Security Administration Act so that a referral for a
medical examination is no longer for the person who applied for review, but for the person
in respect of whom the review is being made. If the amendment were not made the
implication is that applications for review made by the Secretary of State would require him,
rather than the benefit claimant, to attend a medical examination.
The Disability Alliance have expressed concern that these changes are being made in the
absence of any hard evidence of the existence of widespread fraud of either DLA or
Attendance Allowance. They also believe that existing powers are sufficient to deal with
cases of fraud and the extension of the powers proposed in the bill could lead to "fishing"
exercises where there is no existing evidence of fraud. The Alliance also believes that the
regulatory powers given to the Secretary of State in respect of medical examinations should
be more clearly defined, particularly they should only be applied where there is evidence of
a change in circumstances.

E. National insurance numbers (Clause 17)
A national insurance (NI) number is generally allocated to a person in the year preceding their
16th birthday and marks the registration of that person within the state social security system.
People who have never been given a number can apply to their local social security office
with documentary evidence of their identity such as a passport, EC identity card or Home
Office standard acknowledgement letter.
NI numbers are also used as reference numbers in the national computerised PAYE system
and the Inland Revenue has transferred names, addresses, dates of birth and titles of
contributors from the DSS computer.
 
The original purpose of the NI number was to record an individual\'s contributions but with
the increased computerisation of the benefits system, they have become more important in
making claims for social security benefit. However, it is not currently essential to have a NI
number to claim benefits. Legally claimants can receive benefit if they fulfil the conditions
of entitlement. These vary from benefit to benefit, but possession of a NI number is not one
of them. However, the Secretary of State (or the officer acting in this capacity) will need
information and evidence in order to ensure that the claimant does satisfy the conditions. In
particular he or she will need to be satisfied that the claimant is who they say they are. For
most benefits, including income support, the computer systems have a field for the NI
number, so that the claim could not be processed on the computer without this information.
However, provided the officer is satisfied about the claimant\'s identity, the claim can be
processed clerically. For example, where a claimant needed to apply for a NI number, the
Benefits Agency office could assist them with this, and also process their income support
claim.
There has been concern expressed over the past few years about the number of NI numbers
in circulation and the use of false numbers to perpetuate benefit fraud57. In response to this,
the Contributions Agency (the executive agency of the DSS which deals with NI numbers and
records of contributions) is preparing for the introduction of a new recording system which
is due to be operational by 1997. Staff who allocate NI numbers have also been receiving
extra training to combat fraudulent applications for NI numbers.58

Research Paper 96/107
General conditions for entitlement to benefit (as opposed to specific conditions for individual
benefits) are covered by the Social Security Administration Act 1992, Section 1, and the Bill
contains provisions to supplement these.
Clause 17 of the Bill proposes adding to the general conditions for entitlement to benefit by
making it a condition that a claimant, and anybody on whose behalf a claim is being made,
either has a national insurance number or has the evidence to enable him/her to be allocated
with one.
Section (1B) will require that in order to become entitled to any benefit a claim must be
accompanied either by:
 a national insurance number and evidence that the number has been allocated to that
person; or
 information which will enable the claimant\'s number to be ascertained.
If a claimant does not have a national insurance number they will need to apply for one with
the necessary evidence before they can become entitled to benefit. Those without national
insurance numbers will usually be those from abroad but people whose parents did not claim
child benefit and who have not worked may also come into this category.
The evidence required to prove a NI number belongs to the claimant currently depends on the
circumstances of the case and will vary according to the DSS officer\'s view of each case.
Items which may be required to confirm a NI number, according to the DSS, include wage
slips, medical certificates and passports. There is a form to apply for a new NI number and
officers may ask for a passport to confirm a person\'s identity. Providing false information for
these purposes will be an offence. These procedures will not be altered by the proposals in
the Bill but they will become a condition of entitlement to benefit. Concern has been
expressed that this amounts to a method of immigration control and this combined with the
provisions for exchange of information between Government departments contained in the Bill
is likely to fuel this concern.59
Section (1C) allows for regulations to be made which can exempt these provisions from
certain benefits, people or "in other prescribed circumstances."

According to the Financial memorandum to the Bill, the estimated annual cost of these
provisions is £50, 000 but the savings they will produce are "difficult to quantify".
F. Redirection of post and Data Matching (Clauses 18-19)
The issue of claimants arranging for their mail to be redirected to enable them to perpetuate
a fraudulent claim was raised by the Social Security Select Committee.60 The Committee was
informed that requests from local authorities that mail be returned if it was marked \'Please do
not redirect\' were ignored by the Post Office. A Post Office memorandum to the committee
explained that they were resisting such requests because there were a number of operational
and commercial implications.61
In order to obtain information from the Post Office\'s address database, DSS and local
authority staff must currently apply on a case by case basis showing they have good cause
to suspect an individual of fraudulent activity.
Clause 18 inserts new sections 182A to the 1992 Act, and 158A to the 1992 Northern Ireland
Act. These would require social security and local authority mail which would otherwise be
redirected, to be returned to the sender. Section 182A(2) will allow reasonable payments to
be made to the distributor of mail for this service.
Section 182A(6) makes an exemption for mail which is under a court order to be redirected
to the trustees of somebody who has been declared bankrupt. Payments issued are redirected
to trustees to enable them to use the money to repay debtors. 
Clause 19 inserts new sections 182(B) to the 1992 Act and 158(B) to the 1992 Northern
Ireland Act. It would enable staff of the DSS and local authorities to have access to the Post
Office database which details information of people who have paid for their mail to be
redirected. This would remove the need to apply on a case by case basis and would enable
officers to cross reference people who appear both on their own databases and the Post
Office\'s. They will then be able to investigate why these people are having their mail
forwarded and if it is being done as part of fraudulent activity. Section 182(B)(4) will allow
reasonable payments to be made to the Post Office for this service.

Sections 182(B)(5) would prevent the further disclosure of this information to non
Government departments unless it is to be supplied for the purposes of any civil or criminal
proceedings relating to the Social Security Administration Act 1992, the Contributions and
Benefit Act or the Jobseekers Act 1995 (or corresponding Northern Ireland legislation). 
Section 182(B)(6) would allow the further disclosure of information to other Government
departments, such as the Inland Revenue and the Home Office, if it has been used to alter
details which may affect that department\'s dealings with the individual concerned.
Jonathan Bamford, assistant registrar to the Data Protection Registrar, has recently expressed
concern that unless data matching techniques are supported by skilled human intervention and
adequate safeguards, they may result in "unwanted consequences for innocent individuals
[which] may undermine the value of such activities".62
In their response to the Bill, the Post Office have highlighted concerns about how both the
measures will affect them as the major distributor of social security and local authority mail.
While they are committed to the fight against benefit fraud, they feel the bill has been
prepared too hastily and the lack of consultation with the postal service may result in
problems with the practical implementation of the measures. They argue these problems
could damage the reputation of the Royal Mail. The issues raised by the Post Office are:
 The fact that mail is marked \'do not redirect\' will highlight the fact that it may include a
payment and this has implications for the secure return of such mail. 
 it will be practically difficult to distinguish mail redirected to trustees of people who are

Research Paper 96/107
Bill, the DSS have estimated the cost of preventing redirection of mail at £250,000 which
would result in savings in the region of £1 million. The annual running costs for accessing
the postal redirection database are estimated at £400,000 per year leading to annual savings
in the region of £2.2 million.

* Manufacturing productivity growth slowed to 1.3% in 1995.
Economy-wide productivity growth also slowed, but the decline was
less marked. At 1.6%, economy-wide productivity growth was
higher than manufacturing productivity growth for the first time since
1980. 
* The fall in productivity growth is the result of a slowdown in output
growth accompanied by a slight increase in employment. 
* In each of the twelve months to September 1996, productivity growth
in manufacturing has been very modest if not negative. The largest
fall was in August 1996, when output per person was 1.2% lower than
in August 1995. 
* Data showing output per hour in manufacturing have been temporarily
withdrawn. New indices are being constructed and should be
available later this year.

Inflation - consumer prices as measured by the all items RPI rose by 2.7%
in the year to October 1996, up from 2.1% in the previous month.
  
The government\'s target measure of inflation, RPI(X), excludes the effect of
mortgage interest payments (MIPs). RPI(X) rose by 3.3% in the year to
October 1996, up from September\'s figure of 2.9%. Excluding the effects of
MIPs and indirect taxes (RPI(Y)), prices rose by 3.0%.
Earnings - average gross earnings of employees in Great Britain rose by
4.1% in the year to September 1996. The underlying rate, which takes
account of staged agreements and bonuses, is estimated to be 4%.
This rise puts the actual level of average earnings of full-time employees at
around £352.80 per week or £18,345 per year.
Forecasts - the Treasury\'s forecast at the time of the budget suggested that
the RPI (less MIPs) will increase by 2.7% in the year to the fourth quarter
of 1996.
The latest summary of independent forecasts suggests that the RPI (less
MIPs) will rise by 2.9% in the year to the fourth quarter of 1996 and by the
same percentage in the year to the fourth quarter of 1997.
Independent forecasts predict average earnings to rise by 3.8% in 1996 and
4.5% in 1997.

 * The workforce in employment in June 1996 was 124,000 higher than in June 1995 and
416,000 higher than in June 1979. The increase in the number of employees in employment
over the last year was partly offset by falls in the number self-employed, HM Forces and those
on government-supported training schemes.
* In June 1996, 46% of the workforce in employment were female.
* The self-employed in June 1996 represented 13% of workforce in employment compared to
8% in June 1979.

* Interest rates were increased by a quarter of a point on 30 October. The increase was justified on the grounds
of recent increases in the government\'s target measure of inflation and other signs of buoyant growth. Expectations
of interest rate rises are thought to have been a factor behind the recent rise in the value of sterling.
* A rate of 15.0% p.a. was announced on 16th September 1992 but was cancelled before becoming effective.

$ * The strong performance of sterling has continued. Unusually
sterling has gained simultaneously against the dollar and
against European currencies. Consequently sterling\'s trade-
weighted index has reached its highest level since Jan 1995.
It is thought that expectations of lower interest rates in
Europe as well as a correction on previous valuations on
sterling may have fuelled the rise. Brokers generally see the
trend continuing for some time.

* In the first seven months of 1996/97, the PSBR totalled £11.4 billion, compared with £18.7 billion in the same
period of 1995/96. 
* The Treasury PSBR forecasts were revised upwards in the 1996 Summer Economic Forecast to £27 billion in
1996/97 and £23 billion in 1997/98. The average of independent forecasts suggests slightly higher outcomes of
£27.6 billion in 1996/97 and £23.3 billion in 1997/98. New official forecasts will be published on Budget day (26
November).

* Trade by area - In the three months to August 1996, the UK had a £0.7bn deficit on trade in goods
with the EU, which compares with a deficit of £2.2bn with non-EU countries over the same period. In
the three months ended August 1996, the main growth in exports (in value terms) has come from exports
to EU, with the largest rise being in exports to Germany. This was partially offset by a fall in exports
to Belgium. Outside the EU, rises in exports to Oil Exporting Countries and the Rest of the World
contrasted with falls in exports to other Western Europe, North America and Other OECD Countries.
In value terms the main growth in imports has come from North America and Germany. In 1995 the
enlarged European Union (EU 15) received 58.3% of UK exports and supplied 56.6% of all UK imports.
* Volume of Trade  (excluding oil and erratics) - In the three months to August 1996, the volume of
exports and imports both rose 2 per cent compared with the previous three months. Latest estimates of
trends show both export and import volumes rising slightly. 
  
* Trade in oil - The surplus on trade in oil in the three months ended August 1996 was £1.2 billion
compared with £1.1 billion in the previous three months. 
* Non-EC countries - The non-EU visible trade deficit in September was provisionally estimated at
£0.9 billion. Provisional estimates of value (excluding oil and erratics) show exports fell by 1½ per cent
to £5.9 bn. while imports rose 2½ per cent to £6.8 bn. Next update: 27 November

   * Latest annual figures from the SMMT show
1.95 million new registrations of cars in 1995 - 1.8%
higher than 1994. 
  * The SMMT has revised its forecast for 1996 upwards
to over 2 million new registrations. If realised, this
outcome would be the highest since 1989.
   * 154,733 cars were registered in October 1996, an
increase of 13.3% on October 1995. This followed
weak growth over the last couple of months.
   * The rebound in registrations in October was largely
the result of increased private sector registrations
which were up 21 per cent on October 1995.
   * 62% of cars registered in October 1996 were
imported; 19% were diesel and 54% were fleet or
business registrations.
  * The Department of Transport has recently ceased
monthly publication of vehicle registration statistics.

* GDFCF is expenditure on fixed assets (buildings, vehicles etc.) either for replacing or adding to the stock of
existing assets.
* In 1995 total GDFCF (at 1990 prices) is estimated to have fallen by 0.2% compared to 1994 following a rise of
some 3% between 1993 and 1994. In 1995 GDFCF was still 11% lower than the peak in 1989. 
* In the third quarter of 1996, total GDFCF fell by 2.2% compared to the previous quarter. However, the total
remains 3% higher than in the same quarter of 1995.
* A more detailed breakdown for the second quarter of 1996 shows rising fixed investment in vehicles,
ships & aircraft (up 44%) partly offset by falls in the major components of GDFCF: plant & machinery
and other new buildings and works, which fell 5% and 0.4% respectively.

Research Paper 96/109
27 November 1996
This paper sets out the main changes to the personal income tax allowances and reliefs
announced in the Budget of 26 November 1996. It lists the principal personal allowances
which will be available against tax in the tax year 1997-98, and it outlines the conditions
necessary for eligibility for these allowances. As such, the paper provides a summary of the
general tax position in straightforward cases only. It should be stressed that this paper deals
only with tax allowances. No reference is made to cash benefits provided under the social
security system or to national insurance contributions.

Research Paper 96/109
A. Rates and Thresholds
Income tax is charged at three rates - the lower rate, the basic rate, and the higher rate - on
three bands of taxable income. Taxable income excludes personal allowances, which
represent the amount of money someone may receive free of tax. The basic rate of income
tax will be cut by 1% to 23% for 1997-98. The lower and higher rates of income tax are to
be unchanged, and remain at 20% and 40% respectively.
The first £4,100 of an individual\'s taxable income is charged the lower rate for 1997-98. The
lower rate band has been increased by £200 from £3,900; this is £100 above the increase in
line with statutory indexation. Taxable income in excess of the lower rate threshold is
charged the basic rate of 23%. The upper limit of the basic rate band is increased by £600
to £26,100 - which is line with indexation - for 1997-98. Taxable income in excess of this
threshold is charged the higher rate of 40%. The three tax rates and thresholds for 1997-98
are summarised below:
Taxable Income £ Tax Rate
First £4,100 20%
£4,101 - £26,100 23%
Over £26,100 40%
B. Personal Allowances
The statutory requirement to uprate personal allowances in line with inflation - the so-called
"Rooker-Wise" amendment - was introduced under section 22 of the Finance Act 1977, and
is consolidated in section 257C of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988. The
amendment was successfully made through the cross-party co-operation of Jeff Rooker and
Audrey Wise with Nigel Lawson. All three argued that without indexation, inflation acted
as an unauthorised, unintended and an unknown increase in taxation; in other words, taxation
\'by stealth\'. By ensuring that any real changes in allowances would have to be voted on, the
amendment would ensure changes in the tax structure would be \'out in the open\'. At the time
Mr Lawson noted, "this does not hamstring the Chancellor in any way except to remove a
bias which is there at present. It alters the political context and it will therefore have real
consequences."1

Research Paper 96/109
Personal allowances should be increased by a percentage equivalent to the rise in the retail
price index (RPI), rounded up to the nearest £10; the income limit for age allowances should
be increased by a similar proportion but rounded up to the nearest £100. A similar statutory
requirement to uprate the lower and the basic thresholds in line with inflation, unless
Parliament determines otherwise, is provided under section 1 of ICTA 1988. In the case of
thresholds, changes must be rounded up to the nearest multiple of £100.
When uprating the main allowances and thresholds, the relevant inflation rate taken is the
increase in the RPI in the year to September. For the year to September 1996, the inflation
rate was 2.1%.
The ordinary personal allowance is to be increased by £280 for 1997-98, £200 more than the
increase under statutory indexation. The age-related personal allowances are to be increased
by £200 in excess of statutory indexation as well. The married couple\'s allowance, and those
allowances linked to it, are all to be increased by £40 in line with inflation.
1. Personal Allowance
Every taxpayer resident in the United Kingdom is entitled to a personal allowance to be set
against any type of income including investment income. There are three different levels for
1997-98:
Under 65 £4,045
65 - 74 £5,220
75 and over £5,400
All three allowances are to be increased by an additional £200 on top of the increase under
statutory indexation. The basic personal allowance rises by £280; both age related personal
allowances rise by £310. The entitlement to age allowance is determined separately for each
spouse based on their own age. The extra age allowance is reduced above a certain income
limit by £1 for every £2 by which income exceeds the limit (see section B3). However no
aged taxpayer receives less than the basic personal allowance available to those under 65.
The personal allowance is not transferable between spouses.
2. Married Couple\'s Allowance
A married couple\'s allowance (MCA) is given to all married couples. It can be claimed by
either spouse, or divided between them. If no preference is expressed, the allowance is given
to the husband. The wife has the right to claim half the MCA; couples must make a joint
election if she is to claim the entire allowance. A higher allowance is given to couples in
which at least one partner is over 65 years old. A second higher rate is given if one partner
6


Research Paper 96/109
is over 75. Only the basic MCA is transferable between husband and wife; not the higher
rates.
The ordinary MCA and the age-related allowances for 1997-98 are set out below:
Both aged
under 65
£1,830
One or both
aged 65 - 74
£3,185
One or both
aged 75+
£3,225
The MCA is reduced by one twelfth for each complete tax month pre-marriage. The higher
allowances for those over 65 are reduced above a certain income limit by £1 for every £2 of
excess income (see section B3).
In the March 1993 Budget the then Chancellor (Norman Lamont) announced that the MCA
would be restricted to 20 per cent from 6 April 1994, so that its money value would be the
same for all taxpayers whatever their marginal rate of tax. Personal allowances are worth
more to higher rate taxpayers, since they represent a fixed sum which is exempted from tax
at an individual\'s highest marginal tax rate. At that time the basic MCA was set at £1,720,
and was worth £688 for those whose marginal rate was 40 per cent; whereas it was worth
only £344 for 20 per cent taxpayers. Restricting the allowance to 20 per cent meant that all
taxpayers received £344 as a deduction from their final tax bill. In effect the allowance has
become more like a tax credit. In the November 1993 Budget the current Chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, announced that all three MCAs were to be further restricted to 15 per cent
with effect from 1995-96. The 15 per cent restriction will continue to apply to these
allowances for 1997-98. As a result, the ordinary MCA will be worth £274.50 to all
taxpayers. The same restriction applies to the additional personal allowance, and to the
widow\'s bereavement allowance (these allowances are discussed below).
As a result of the introduction of independent taxation in April 1990, transitional allowances
were introduced to minimise the loss faced by those couples where the wife was the
breadwinner, and those couples where the wife was in a higher age allowance band than her
husband. These arrangements will affect fewer people as the years go by. Details are given
in Independent Taxation, Library Research Note 90/9, 5 February 1990.
3. Income Limit for Age Allowance
Taxpayers claiming an age-related allowance whose income exceeds £15,600 for 1997-98 will
have their allowance reduced by £1 for every £2 that their income exceeds this limit. This
progressive reduction continues until the allowance is equal in value to that of the ordinary
7


Research Paper 96/109
personal allowance or the basic MCA. The income limit has been increased in line with
inflation, from the limit of £15,200 for 1996-97. For individual taxpayers qualifying for an
age-related personal allowance the benefit of the allowance will not fall out until the
following levels:
65 - 74 £17,950
75 and over £18,310
For the MCA, the figures will depend on the age of the husband and of the older spouse. The
age-related personal allowance is reduced before the age-related MCA, when any individual\'s
tax bill is calculated.2
4. Additional Personal Allowance
An additional personal allowance (APA) is available in respect of individuals caring for
children, and for husbands caring for an incapacitated wife. The allowance is equal in value
to the ordinary married couple\'s allowance: £1,830 for 1997-98, restricted to 15 per cent. The
child may be the claimant\'s natural or adopted child, or simply a child maintained at the
claimant\'s expense (eg, fostered). The child has to be under 18, unless he or she is in full-
time education or in an apprenticeship of at least two years\' duration. Those eligible for the
APA are:
• a woman who is not, throughout the tax year in question, married and living with
her husband.
• a man who is not, for all or part of the tax year in question, married and living with
his wife.3
• a man who is, for all or part of the tax year in question, living with his wife, if she
is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity throughout the tax year (of
course, in this case, the allowance would be given in addition to the MCA). Married
women caring for their incapacitated spouse are not eligible for the allowance.
Single or divorced women, as well as widows, widowers, and single men, may claim the
APA, provided they are taking care of at least one child (only one allowance is paid,
irrespective of the number of children cared for by the claimant). If both parents, living apart,
claim the allowance in respect of the same child, then they may elect to have it split between
them. If they cannot agree, the allowance is split in proportion to the amount of time each
parent spends with the child.4

Research Paper 96/109
5. Spouse\'s Transitional Exemption
The tax treatment of maintenance was changed substantially by provisions in the Finance Act
1988. Previously, those providing maintenance could apply for tax relief at their marginal
rate of tax on their payments. The person receiving maintenance - ex-spouse or child - would
be taxed on this income. The 1988 reform removed these transactions from the tax system.
Those who make payments cannot claim them against tax, and those who receive them are
not taxed on them. This applies to all maintenance payments made under a court order, a
Child Support Agency assessment, or other type of legally binding agreement, made after 15
March 1988.
Separated or divorced individuals who pay maintenance direct to their ex-spouse qualify for
a limited form of tax relief, sometimes called a \'maintenance allowance\', equivalent to the
MCA (ie, an allowance of no more than £1,830). This relief is not extended to those making
maintenance payments to an ex-partner, rather than to an ex-spouse, and it does not cover
maintenance paid to children. Individuals may claim relief for payments made to more than
one ex-spouse, but however many people they make payments to, the total amount of relief
given in any one tax year is the same. Tax relief is withdrawn if the ex-spouse who receives
maintenance remarries. Relief has been restricted in the same way as the MCA: to 20 per
cent for 1994-95, and to 15 per cent for 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98.
Under agreements made before 15 March 1988, the taxpayer will continue to receive tax relief
at the level he or she was allowed in 1988-89, through the PAYE system. Tax relief on the
first £1,830 of maintenance paid is restricted to 15 per cent for 1997-98. Those who receive
maintenance under the old system receive it gross. Where payments are made direct to an
ex-spouse, the first £1,830 may be received tax free (this relief has not been restricted).
6. Widows Bereavement Allowance
The widows bereavement allowance (WBA) is intended to relieve some of the financial
distress of bereavement. It is set equal to the basic MCA (ie, £1,830 restricted to 15 per cent
for 1997-98). The allowance may be claimed as well as the additional personal allowance,
and, of course, the personal allowance. It is available from the date of the death to the end
of the following tax year, and applies against the widow\'s own income in this period. There
is no corresponding allowance for widowers.
7. Blind Person\'s Allowance
Any person registered as blind is entitled to the blind person\'s allowance (BPA). The
allowance is worth £1,280 for 1997-98, having been increased in line with inflation on the
previous year. Unlike the married couple\'s allowance, and those allowances linked to it, the
BPA is not restricted in value. If someone has insufficient income to make use of the
9


Research Paper 96/109
allowance, it can be transferred to a spouse. In his 1996 Budget, the Chancellor proposed that
the WBA would become subject to the same statutory requirement for indexation as the other
income tax allowances.

C. Benefits - Company Cars & Free Fuel
In April 1994 the system of car benefit charges - based on the size of a car\'s engine - was
replaced by a new system, based on the car\'s list price. A charge of 35 per cent of the price
of a car is made, with discounts for business mileage and older cars.
The tax charge on the benefit of free fuel used in company cars for 1997-98 will increase by
13 per cent for petrol cars, and 15 per cent for diesel cars. The intention is to increase the
tax charge on the benefit of free fuel in line with the prices other drivers pay for their fuel.
The scale charges for 1997-98 are:

D. Pensions
The pension scheme earnings cap will be increased in line with inflation, from £82,200 to
£84,000 for 1997-98. This is the maximum earnings from which contributions to a personal
or occupational pension scheme can attract tax relief.
E. Charities
There is no general tax exemption or relief granted to taxpayers who make gifts to charities,
though there are specific reliefs covering regular donations made out of one\'s salary (payroll
giving), and one-off cash gifts of a minimum size (Gift Aid), as well as to covenanted
donations.
The payroll giving scheme is designed to encourage employees to make contributions to
charity. The maximum amount which an employee can give remains £1,200 per year, set by
the Finance Act 1996. The annual amount paid in this way is wholly deductible for income
tax purposes, the relief being given through the PAYE system. The employer deducts the
appropriate sum from a participating employee\'s pay, and passes it to an agency who
distributes it to the charity or charities of the employee\'s choice. Gift Aid allows income tax
relief for single donations by individuals. When this relief was introduced, the minimum limit
was £600; the current minimum is £250, set by the Finance Act 1993.

Research Paper 96/109
F. Mortgages
There is no change to the £30,000 limit on loans qualifying for interest relief for the purchase
of a main residence. Tax relief on mortgage interest (MIRAS) was limited to the basic rate
of income tax from 6 April 1991. Relief was restricted to 20 per cent from 6 April 1994, and
to 15 per cent from 6 April 1995. MIRAS remains restricted to 15 per cent for 1997-98.
G. Capital Gains Tax
The annual exempt amount has been increased in line with statutory indexation, to £6,500 for
individuals, in accordance with the indexation of thresholds for capital taxes incorporated in
sections 80 and 91 of the Finance Act 1982. Gains are then taxed at one\'s marginal rate of
income.
H. Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is levied on the value of a person\'s estate at the time of their death. Generally,
personal gift giving is free from tax. However most gifts made out of someone\'s estate within
seven years of their death are assessed as part of that person\'s estate, and are liable to tax as
well. The tax is charged at 40 per cent above the tax-free threshold. This is increased from
£200,000 to £215,000 for 1997-98, £10,000 in excess of indexation. This follows a
substantial increase of £46,000 last year. Taken together, the threshold has increased by
nearly 40 per cent in two years (ie, from £154,000 to £215,000).
I. Profit Related Pay
Profit Related Pay (PRP) is that part of an employee\'s pay which rises, and falls, in line with
the profits of the business in which they work. Provided PRP is paid under a scheme
registered with the Inland Revenue, the employee may receive it free of income tax, up to a
given limit: either 20% of their salary, or £4,000, whichever is the lower, in the profit period
to which the PRP relates. A \'profit period\' is the employer\'s accounting period, normally 12
months. Currently, basic-rate taxpayers receiving PRP will pay up to £960 less income tax
(24 per cent of £4,000) than an equivalent employee not receiving PRP. Higher-rate
taxpayers pay up to £1,600 per year less income tax.
12


Research Paper 96/109
The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, has proposed in his November 1996 Budget that tax relief
for PRP be phased out over a three to four year period; so that for profit periods beginning
 • before 1 January 1998, there will be no change in the £4,000 ceiling on relief;
 • between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1998, the ceiling will be reduced to £2,000;
 • between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 1999, the ceiling will be reduced to £1,000;
 • on or after 1 January 2000, no relief will be available.

Research Paper 96/111
A. Introduction
Under the former rules this benefit was generally not affected by a hospital stay. Regulations
came into force on 31 July 1996 so that the allowance generally ceases after 4 weeks as an
in-patient (12 weeks in the case of a child). They are due for debate on 5 December 1996.
Some transitional protection for existing recipients is provided as described in the note.
Further discussion of the regulations and more detailed summary of responses to the
consultation exercise can be found in the Report by the Social Security Advisory Committee
on SI 1996/14361. This includes the regulations, an explanatory memorandum from the DSS
on the original regulations, a summary of the representations made to the SSAC, the SSAC
report on the regulations and the Secretary of State\'s statement on the report.
B. Disability living allowance - the former rules
Disability living allowance (DLA) is a benefit for disabled people. Its main features are:
• Available to both children and adults;
• Introduced in April 1992, replacing the old mobility allowance and attendance
allowance for people under 65 with a single benefit;
• Aimed at people who need help looking after themselves and who have difficulty
walking;
• Tax-free, not means-tested or related to national insurance contributions;
• Provided a person continued to satisfy the conditions of entitlement, the mobility
component of DLA was unaffected by a hospital stay. The care component is not paid
after 4 weeks for adults or 12 weeks for children.

Research Paper 96/111
There are two elements to DLA:
• a care component for help with personal care needs, paid at three different levels;
• a mobility component for help with walking difficulties, paid at two levels. The
higher rate is currently £33.90 pw and the lower £12.90 pw.
It is paid in addition to earnings or other income and generally the whole allowance is paid
on top of any other social security benefits.
The regulations affect the mobility component. To qualify for this, a person must be over 5
and under 66 when they first claim. The must also be able, from time to time, to benefit from
"facilities for enhanced locomotion"2. Thus a person who cannot be moved for medical
reasons would not be eligible. They must also satisfy the disability conditions, detailed
below:
DLA mobility component conditions of entitlement
For the higher rate a person must be:
either suffering from a physical disability such that they are
unable to walk;
or suffering from a physical disability such that they are
virtually unable to walk;
or both deaf and blind;
or a double amputee or have been born without feet;
or severely mentally impaired and have severe
behavioural problems and qualify for the highest rate
of disability living allowance care component.
For the lower rate a person needs to show that although they
are able to walk they are so severely disabled, physically or
mentally, that, ignoring familiar routes, they are unable to
take advantage of their walking abilities outdoors without
guidance or supervision from another person most of the time.
For both rates a person must have satisfied one of these
conditions for at least the past 3 months and be likely to
satisfy it for the next 6 months (unless they are terminally ill)

C. Disability living allowance - the new rules
From 31 July 1996, the mobility component of DLA is no longer paid after 4 weeks of an in-
patient stay (12 weeks for children). 
The change was first announced briefly by Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security,
in his 1995 statement on the uprating of benefits. Among a number of measures to remove
anomalies, he proposed to "align the mobility component of disability living allowance more
closely with similar benefits that are withdrawn during hospital stays."3 The reasons for the
change were explained in an accompanying press notice:4
"DLA is intended to help with the extra costs arising out of a disability and the
mobility component is primarily intended to help disabled people be
independently mobile.
Hospital patients, especially acute patients, have little scope to be
independently mobile whilst in hospital and most of their needs are met by the
NHS. Most other Social Security benefits are either withdrawn or reduced
when a person goes into hospital to prevent duplicate provision from public
funds. It cannot be right to pay people who are unable to use the benefit for
the purpose intended and who are already having most of their needs met by
the taxpayer.
We believe the move is justified in ensuring that taxpayers\' money goes to
those best placed to benefit from it."
In the DSS\' Explanatory Memorandum to the SSAC it was suggested that hospitals are
accumulating large sums of money from unspent benefits paid to in-patients. Also, in some
cases where the NHS was already meeting all a patient\'s needs, the allowance was being used
to buy tobacco, cigarettes, sweets etc, rather than for mobility purposes. The DSS maintains
this is evidence of the healthcare and social security systems overlapping, both providing for
the same contingencies, and DLA as a result is either unspent or inappropriately spent.
1. Transitional protection
Partial protection was provided for some existing recipients of mobility component of DLA.
The regulations include provision to continue to pay the mobility component at the lower

rate only to some patients who when the regulations come into force have been in hospital
for more than 12 months.
Excluded, or partially excluded, from this protection are those who:
• are committed to a hospital following involvement in criminal proceedings or under
sentence5 and those who have been compulsorily admitted to hospital because of their
need for care and treatment as a result of their mental disorder6. They will be
excluded from the protection given to other long stay patients;
• use their mobility component to pay for a car under the Motability scheme. They will
have their benefit paid at the higher of the lower rate or the level required to meet
payments under the agreement for the hire or hire-purchase of the vehicle;
• have been a NHS in-patient for less than 12 months at the time of the change.
In his statement on the regulations, Peter Lilley argues "that it has long been accepted that
a person\'s needs are fully met during a period of hospital treatment. Where no charge is made
for that treatment, any payment of benefit intended to meet the same needs would amount to
double provision from public funds. For this reason, most Social Security benefits are
withdrawn or reduced after a period, commonly 6 weeks, of free in-patient treatment in a
hospital or similar institution."7 
DLA mobility component is unusual in being largely unaffected by a spell as a hospital in-
patient. It is common for benefits to be reduced during hospital stays. Often this first takes
place at six weeks or later. The proposals for DLA mobility component for those in hospital
would align it with the care component and Attendance Allowance which are withdrawn after
four weeks in the case of an adult. The payment of benefits for a short spell as an in-patient
recognises that financial commitments do not necessarily stop when someone goes into
hospital; also they avoid the administrative costs of making adjustments of benefits for short
hospital stays. Appendix 1 shows how a spell as a hospital in-patient affects various non-
means-tested benefits.

D. SSAC consultation and response
The proposed regulations were referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC).
The SSAC requested representations to be made in a consultation exercise ending on
12 February 1996. There were 189 responses and the overwhelming view of these was that
the proposals were based on false information and should not be implemented. The SSAC
concurred with this view and also thought the proposals would introduce many anomalies.
Its main conclusion was that the proposals should not be proceeded with in their present form.
The SSAC also made a number of secondary recommendations, including:
• A more rigorous analysis of the appropriateness and availability of NHS funding for
the mobility needs of patients should be carried out;
• Persons detained under Part II or III of the Mental Health Act 1983 should have the
same entitlement as other patients;
• Consideration should be given to patients who need to initiate or renew a Motability
agreement before they are able to leave hospital;
• A more gradual downrating of the mobility component for long-stay patients should
be examined.
• A linking rule should be introduced in determining the 12 month period for
transitional protection;
The Government agreed with the last of these, and the regulations now allow people who are
out of hospital for 28 days or less between in-patient stays to be treated if they had been
continuously in hospital, and provision for this is now contained in the regulations8. However
they were unable to accept the other recommendations and considered the overall case for
change to be "compelling".9
The final regulations were laid before Parliament on 7 June 1996 and came into force on 31
July 1996.10

Research Paper 96/111
E. Reactions to the regulations
The overwhelming view of respondents to the SSAC consultation exercise was that the
proposals were based on false information and should not be implemented, also that
implementation of the proposals would cause individual patients financial hardship and could
lengthen their stay and thus increase other areas of public expenditure.11
The main concerns of respondents underlying their views were:
• False assumptions made about the lack of mobility needs of long-stay patients and the
meeting of them by the NHS. The fact finding exercise carried out by the DSS was
fundamentally flawed in not talking to patients or those directly responsible for their
day-to-day care;
• Alignment with DLA care component ignores separate benefit history and objectives.
While it is easy to argue the NHS provides for the care needs of a patient and to give
benefit for these would be \'double provision\', it is less clear that the NHS provides for
all mobility needs in the same way.
                                          
• Long-stay patients, particularly, are often in hospitals in isolated areas and mobility
component can be used to enable them to make and receive visits. This is even more
important where children are involved;
• There is evidence that in many cases the mobility component is used imaginatively
and constructively to enhance the quality of life of long-stay patients. Unspent
balances are evidence of poor organisation and provision rather than lack of mobility
need;
• Patients in NHS-provided homes and hospitals will be worse-off than those in homes
provided by other bodies even though care provided and needs may be similar. The
proposals run counter to the efforts to transfer care from hospital to community-based;
• Transitional protection does not include people who have been in hospital for less than
a year who will lose benefit at 4 weeks. Also the exclusion of those in special
hospitals, secure units and those detained in low/no security hospitals effectively puts
them in the same position as convicted prisoners (who are already barred from benefit)
rather than patients;
• Restriction of protection to those who have a vehicle via Motability excludes anyone
who has similar private arrangements. Also that it will not be possible to renew a
Motability agreement while in hospital;

• It is already possible under existing legislation12 to deny benefit to claimants who are
unable to benefit from enhanced mobility. The reasons given by the DSS are not
sufficient to justify the regulations.
A fuller summary of representations made to the SSAC appears in its report.13
F. Numbers affected and savings
The DSS estimates some 40,000 people would have their benefit payments of mobility
component reduced or withdrawn: 25,000 people on the higher rate who would have been in
hospital for 12 months or more at the time of the change would have their payments reduced;
15,000 who are either in-patients of less than 12 months or new cases would have benefit
withdrawn.14
Within the group of patients who have been in hospital for more than 12 months are around
3,000 patients in special hospitals or secure units whose payments would cease.
Around 35,000 patients receiving the lower rate who would have been in hospital for
12 months or more at the change will see no variation in their benefit.
The savings from the change are put at £25 million in 1996/7 and £40 million in 1997/8.
Around three-quarters of the savings are due to the change in the rules for adults and a
quarter from the change as it affects children.15
A number of respondents to the consultation exercise questioned whether the cost of the
change can be measured entirely in terms of benefits no longer paid. They pointed out that
some of the savings could be offset by additional costs faced by the NHS if the change results
in prolonging the length of stay of patients or hindering efforts to provide rehabilitation.

Research Paper 96/113
11th December 1996
It is the Government\'s policy to dispose of certain classes of radioactive waste in a deep
underground repository near Sellafield. To develop the safety case UK Nirex Ltd hopes to
build an underground rock laboratory called the Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF)
which is currently the subject of a contentious planning appeal.
In this paper the history of Government policy to dispose of this class of radioactive
waste is outlined; aspects of the safety case for the repository, including the function of
the RCF are presented; the views of independent authorities and environmental groups are
given, and the position in other countries is outlined.

Research Paper 96/113
I Introduction
Nirex was established by the nuclear industry in 1982 and is funded by organisations which
make use of its facilities for radioactive wastes: its name is an acronym for "Nuclear Industry
Radioactive Waste Management Executive". Nirex\'s remit is to develop disposal routes for
intermediate-level waste (ILW) and certain types of relatively hazardous low-level waste
(LLW) (see later). It is important to differentiate between disposal, which implies
permanency, and storage, which is designed as a temporary measure.
After numerous deliberations Nirex is currently working to provide and manage a deep
underground repository for the wastes within its remit at Longlands Farm, near Sellafield in
Cumbria. In addition to a test drilling programme involving a series of boreholes, Nirex
proposes to excavate a Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF) or "rock laboratory" at the site
to develop its safety case prior to excavating the repository itself. It is the RCF, at present
at the centre of a contentious planning appeal, which is the subject of this paper.
Major features of the Government\'s radioactive waste management policy are described in
Library Research Paper 96/30 - Radioactive Waste: Some Topical Issues. This sets Nirex\'s
position within the UK\'s policy for radioactivity waste management in context.

II. History
Nirex has arrived at its present position by a long and tortuous route. Several other policies
and sites have been considered and rejected along the way, not least because of public dissent
characterised by the Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) syndrome1:
37. When Nirex was established by the nuclear industry in 1982, its task, in line with the
Government\'s policy at that time, was to develop two disposal routes for ILW and LLW:
(a) deep disposal of long-lived ILW in an underground repository; and
(b) shallow burial of LLW and short-lived ILW in engineered trenches 20 to 30
metres below the surface.
Initially, Nirex explored the possibility of developing a disused ICI anhydrite mine at
Billingham in Cleveland as a deep repository, but in 1985, following local and national
controversy, ICI decided not to make the mine available to Nirex. At the Government\'s
request, Nirex than concentrated on finding a site for a shallow repository for LLW and short-
lived ILW.
38. Elstow in Bedfordshire had originally been identified in 1983 as the potential site for a
shallow repository, but in 1986 Nirex\'s investigations were widen to include three other
locations in the clay geology of Eastern England. The same year, the Government accepted
the recommendations of the Environment Select Committee that no ILW should be disposed
of in near-surface facilities. In 1987, the proposals were dropped and Nirex concentrated
instead on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose facility for both ILW and
LLW. This, it argued, would be the most cost-effective solution.
39. In 1989, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced Nirex\'s recommendation
that a deep repository should be developed on land rather than under the sea and that the next
step should be to carry out detailed geological studies in the vicinity of Sellafield and
Dounreay. The Government agreed that further exploratory work was necessary before any
particular site could be decided on. In July 1991, Nirex announced that it would concentrate
its investigations on Sellafield. In addition to its test-drilling programme there, Nirex
proposes to excavate a Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF), or "rock laboratory", more than
650 m deep in order to help develop the safety case for the repository.

Research Paper 96/113
A planning application for the RCF was submitted to Cumbria County Council on 1 February
1994 and refused on 20 December. This is separate from the planning application for the
repository itself, for which the Government has promised2 its own full public inquiry.
On 27 February 1995 the Environment Secretary, John Gummer, announced3 that a planning
appeal by Nirex for the RCF would be considered in September 1995. This took place and
closed on 1 February 1996. The report of the appeal was originally expected to be delivered
to the Secretary of State for the Environment by the end of October. In the answer to a
recent parliamentary question this date was postponed4:
Dr John Cunningham : To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment (1) when he
expects to make a decision on the planning appeal for the construction of a rock
characterisation facility at Longlands farm, Gosforth, Cumbria;
(2) when he expects to receive the planning inspector\'s report relating to the inquiry into the
construction of a rock characterisation facility at Longlands farm, Gosforth, Cumbria.
Mr Jones: The Planning Inspectorate has advised that it expects to send the report to my
right Hon. Friend the Secretary of State in mid-December. Until we have received and
considered the report, I cannot say when the decision on the appeal might be made.
The announcement that it is uncertain when a decision on the appeal might be made is
interesting. Similar uncertainties have surrounded previous cases. Most notably the decision
about a shallow repository. In that instance the decision to drop plans was announced just
before parliament was dissolved for the 1987 election5. Dr David Clark for the Labour Party
welcomed the decision and said:
However, we recognise, as does the rest of the country, that the Government have acted only
in a squalid attempt to save themselves from electoral embarrassment. There can be no other
explanation for this announcement being made today. If I lived in one of the four
constituencies affected, I would need more reassurance than that given by the Government
that they will not reverse the policy if by an accident they happen to win the next election.

III. Classes of Radioactive Waste
Radioactive waste in the UK is divided into four broad categories depending upon its
radioactivity and associated heat generating capacity:
• High-Level Waste (HLW) is waste in which sufficient heat is generated for
this to be a significant consideration in the design of storage and disposal
facilities. Essentially HLW consists of fission products (ie the radioactive
remains) of uranium and plutonium from spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors;
• Intermediate-Level Waste (ILW)  is waste in which the radioactive decay
process generates insufficient heat for this to be a design requirement in
storage or disposal facilities, but with activity levels above that defined as the
upper limit for low-level waste (see below). It comprises cladding from spent
nuclear fuel, filters and wastes from effluent treatment, worn-out plant and
equipment, and radioactive materials used in medical treatments, industry and
defence;
• Low-Level Waste (LLW) is waste which contains radioactive materials above
the very low-level waste acceptable for disposal with ordinary refuse, but
below 4 GBq6 per tonne of alpha (α)7 or 12 GBq per tonne of β8/γ9 activity.
It includes rubble and steelwork from decommissioning of nuclear reactors and
items such as rubber glovers and protective clothing;
• Very Low-Level Waste (VLLW) is waste which can safely be disposed of
with ordinary refuse.
Nirex\'s remit is to develop disposal routes only for ILW and a small quantity of relatively
hazardous LLW which are α-emitters of long half-life10.
                                                                                                                                                                           
6
 1 GBq (gigabequerel) is 1,000,000,000 radioactive emissions per second.
7
 alpha or α-particles consist of two protons and two neutrons which form the nucleus, or central heavy part
of the helium atom.
8
 beta or β-particles are electrons which are constituents of atoms.
9
 gamma or γ-rays are electromagnetic rays, like light.
10
 the half-life is the time taken for half of any given amount of a radioactive element to decay.
8


Research Paper 96/113
Currently ILW is stored on the surface at nuclear power stations and other facilities. At
present there is a volume that would cover a football pitch to a depth of 40 feet (90,000 cu
metres). This is expected to double early on next century11. 
Most LLW is currently disposed off by shallow burial at British Nuclear Fuels\' Drigg site in
Cumbria. This is not expected to be full until well into next century.

IV. Containment of Radioactivity in the Repository
Radioactivity decays with time. In many cases this occurs relatively quickly, but certain
elements have such a long half-life that significant radioactivity remains for many thousands
of years. Because the hazard associated with radioactive waste, although constantly
decreasing, remains for such a long time in some cases, it is necessary to ensure its prolonged
containment in the proposed repository. To this end a set of man-made and natural barriers
are planned to isolate the waste from man\'s environment12:
• the waste would be packed in steel drums or boxes with a cement mixture
poured to the brim. This in itself is expected to provide a high degree of
physical containment for at least 1,000 years during which time about 99% of
the radioactivity will have decayed;
• a special cement grout has been developed which would be used to back-fill
the space between the drums after they have been placed underground. The
chemical nature of this grout will ensure that alkaline13 conditions are
maintained for upwards of 1,000,000 years. By this time more than 99.99% of
the original radioactivity will have decayed. In addition the grout is porous
enough to allow "sorption" ie the attachment of materials to its surface. Such
conditions help to chemically and physically immobilise the radioactive
materials within the repository;
• the repository, which would be sealed upon-closure, is planned about half-a-
mile underground. The overlying rocks provide the final barrier to prevent
radioactive material reaching the human environment.
The aim is to prevent radioactive material from coming into contact with groundwater in
which it could dissolve, because this is the principal route by which radioactive material could
be transported from a repository through the overlying rock to the surface where it could
affect humans.

 Alkaline describes a solution that has an excess of hydroxide ions. This condition slows the rate that
radioactive material will dissolve in groundwater.

Research Paper 96/113
V. The Rock Characterisation Facility
Despite the integrity of the containment designed for the radioactive material planned for the
repository, it is essential for Nirex to prove that the proposed repository will be safe. To
achieve this Nirex formulated a scientific programme to carry out a post-closure performance
assessment (PCSA) for a repository at Longlands Farm near Sellafield. It comprised
activities to14:
- characterise the geological and hydrogeological conditions at the site which will
influence the post-closure safety performance of a repository.
- develop the data and models to describe the processes influencing radionuclide return
to the human environment.
Results from these activities feed into the development of the methodology and models which
will be used to evaluate post-closure safety performance.
 
To this end numerous boreholes have been drilled in the area. These provide rock cores
which can be examined mineralogically. In addition equipment which emits and detects
sound waves can be lowered into the boreholes. This is employed in a technique known as
seismic tomography (similar to the technique used in whole body scanners in hospitals) to
build up a picture of the rock structure. Groundwater flow properties have also been
measured, and samples of groundwater and dissolved gases at depth have been taken to
investigate groundwater age and evolution. Boreholes, however, are only able to yield some
of the information required. To determine detail an underground laboratory known as the
Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF) is necessary. 
The main objectives of the RCF programme were stated in Nirex Report 32715as follows:
- to provide geological and hydrogeological characterisation data and scope for a model
validation programme which will permit a firmer assessment of long-term safety:
- to provide data needed to decide on a footprint, design and orientation for a
repository within the geologically suitable zone; and

- to provide geotechnical data on rock competence and fracture characteristics to
inform decisions on repository construction methods and to enable cost estimates to
be refined.
The same Nirex Report also explained the testing capabilities that the RCF would offer in
addition to surface-based investigations already carried out:
- bulk data can be obtained in three dimensions from a large volume of rock, rather
than from isolated lengths of rock core drilled from the surface;
- specialised tests can be performed directly on specific features; and
- tests are less constrained by the limitation of design or location of surface
investigations.
It is planned that the RCF will develop in phases16. Two deep vertical shafts will be sunk to
about 920m and 790m from the surface. These will each be 5m in diameter and 50m apart.
From these, three main horizontal galleries will be constructed each about 150m long at a
depth currently planned to be 735m below the surface. Two of these galleries will be
extended to 375m and 600m, and three further galleries up to 200m will be constructed. The
following diagram is a representation of the RCF at completion17.

At each phase various aspects of the scientific programme will be carried out. Further details
are available in Nirex\'s Memorandum for the RWMAC18.
In terms of financial cost Nirex has already spent £400m on research to assess the safety of
underground disposal, and a further £200m is expected to be spent on the RCF19.

VI. Views of Independent Bodies
Three major independent bodies have carried out evaluations of the scientific issues associated
with deep disposal of radioactive waste in the UK. These are the Royal Society, the
Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC), and Her Majesty\'s
Inspectorate of Pollution. These evaluations were quoted by those giving evidence to the
RCF Inquiry.
A. The Royal Society Report
The Royal Society Report20 was concerned with the development of generic guidelines for an
underground repository irrespective of the specific site.
After its deliberations the society retained an open mind whether Sellafield has the potential
to be the site for a deep underground repository. In the context of Nirex\'s current plans for
such a repository it expressed concern in its recommendations about several issues. One of
these was the short timescale proposed:
The timetable of the programme needs to respect the fact that much of the science essential
for long-term performance of repositories for long-lived wastes is still at an early stage of
development.
The society suggested splitting the research and development programmes into two. One
programme would deal with short-lived ILW and some LLW for which repository
characteristics are well established, the other requiring extra time and further work aimed at
long-lived ILW and possibly HLW:
A more robust strategy for the UK would entail aiming to construct an initial part of the
repository for short-lived wastes within the zone of rock that Nirex are presently characterising
in detail, with a more extended programme for the disposal of long-lived wastes, possibly in
a second-phase repository sited deeper and in a west-ward extension of the presently defined
potential repository zone, but sharing common access and surface facilities. The practicability
of disposing of high level wastes, as well as long-lived intermediate level wastes, in this
second-phase repository could be investigated with advantage.

Comments were also made that Nirex should make its research results more widely available
and open for peer review, a criticism also expressed by others21:
The iterative process of developing post-closure performance assessments for UK deep
repositories for radioactive wastes should be open to wide scientific peer review, particularly
the databases, the interpretation of site-specific data and the analysis of assessment results for
specific potential repository sites. This would complement the peer review of Nirex generic
research that already takes place through publication and international cooperation. The fact
that Nirex initiated the present study is a positive signal of willingness to seek external inputs
to their scientific strategy.
The society recommended further research on the effect of future climate change and
groundwater movement to assist in the post-closure performance assessments:
A range of scenarios to represent the possible long-term evolutions of conditions at repository
sites, addressing the consequences of climate changes through future glacial periods, needs to
be developed in order to make substantial progress in assessing the post-closure performance
of repositories for long-lived wastes.
For credible assessments of the long-term performance of repositories, there is a need for a
more profound understanding of groundwater movement in fractured rocks, particularly in
response to the influence of climate change. For the macroscale, use should be made of
observed geochemistry and simulations of the historical conditions that have led to it. At an
intermediate scale, fracture flow determined by tracer tests and other field experiments should
be used to improve knowledge of the relationships between fracture patterns and groundwater
movement, and hence to calibrate numerical models of flow.
In the previous paragraph \'macroscale\' refers to the large-scale overview of the groundwater
movement, and \'tracer tests\' are experiments in which a small (or trace) quantity of a
detectable substance is introduced into the groundwater at one point and by detecting where
it emerges groundwater movement can be charted.
In conclusion the society recognised the need for an RCF and the role it will play in the
establishment of the safety case:

Research Paper 96/113
The "rock characterisation facility" (RCF) will provide a valuable base for site-specific studies,
and should be operated for a long enough period to enable such studies to contribute
substantially to detailed post-closure performance assessments. Nirex should encourage wide
international participation in the planning and performance of experiments undertaken at the
RCF, and in the interpretation of the experimental results.
B. The RWMAC Report
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC) was established in 1978
to advise the Government on civil radioactive waste management issues. In 1994 Nirex
invited RWMAC to carry out a review of its scientific mission for the proposed RCF. At
the same time Cumbria County Council also asked RWMAC to comment on a number of
issues related to the RCF, including its potential role beyond its function as a rock laboratory
for generic purposes.
The RWMAC Report22 addressed all of these issues. In its conclusion the Report endorsed
the need for the RCF to enable the safety case to be made for the proposed repository.
RWMAC expressed concern, however, about the timescale for the scientific programme and
questioned whether sufficient data would be available for the inquiry into the repository itself.
It also mentioned the need to use the RCF as an integral part of the repository to meet a
commissioning date for it of about 201023.
The RCF is an integral and necessary part of the overall Nirex science programme forming
an essential step in establishing the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of
construction. The timing of the RCF, in relation to the current overall Nirex programme, is
such that only limited data will be available at the time that a planning application would be
made for the repository. It is, however, important that the results of the RCF programme be
available in time for that inquiry. For Nirex to have assurance of achieving the planned date
for commissioning of the repository by around 2010, then it would be necessary to use the
RCF shafts for construction purposes.
It is this secondary use of the RCF which has led environmental groups to question whether
the RCF is a "trojan horse" for the repository24.

C. Her Majesty\'s Inspectorate of Pollution Assessment
Her Majesty\'s Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) have carried out a highly technical assessment
of the site characterisation near Sellafield25. In addition to a review of Nirex\'s reports,
reviews have been carried out of the geology of the East Irish Sea Basin and fracturing within
the Borrowdale Volcanic Group where the repository is planned. The Assessment praises
the high quality of Nirex work:
The quality of work which Nirex have and are continuing to carry out in the Sellafield area
is generally of a very high standard, with the quality of the core material and the care taken
to achieve the highest quality results being admirable. Much of the work carried out is an
object lesson on how to carry out a site investigation. There is still, however, much left to
do and this section of the report sets out where data and understanding are still lacking, and
where uncertainties remain.
The work reviewed and suggested is of a highly technical nature and is therefore not dealt
with here, but can be accessed in the Assessment itself if required.

VII. Opposition from Environmental Groups
Two of the main environmental groups in the UK, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth
(FOE), have differing perspectives upon disposal of radioactive waste.
A. Greenpeace
Greenpeace is wholly opposed to disposal (which it terms \'dumping\') and would prefer storage
so that waste would be retrievable26:
The problems of nuclear waste should be recognised as intractable. All that can be hoped for
is a \'least bad\' approach that takes account of public concern and minimises the burdens on
future generations. Nuclear waste should be stored, monitored, and retrieved if something
goes wrong. Dumping is an irreversible commitment of nuclear waste to the environment.
The only solution is to stop nuclear waste production at source. That means closing down
Britain\'s nuclear power stations and plutonium reprocessing factories.
Greenpeace has specific objection to the choice of the site near Sellafield for the repository.
It questions the grounds upon which the decision was based: was it scientific evidence or
political expediency27.
The site has been described by Sir Hugh Rossi MP, former Chairman of the Environment
Select Committee of the House of Commons, as politically \'the easiest solution\', being in an
area where the public are dependent on the nuclear industry for their livelihoods. At the same
time, geological criteria for site selection have been ignored.
The properties of the rock in which the waste is to be buried are intended to help isolate it
from the environment for hundreds of thousands of years, but Nirex have broken UK,
European Community and International Atomic Energy Authority guidelines in their
choice of site:
The proposed dump is in a major fault zone.
Radioactive springs forming as a result of an earthquake in the area could supply
drinking water. Springs have formed in the recent past following an earthquake
along the same fault zone.
                                                                                                                                                                           
26

 Earthquake, Greenpeace, November 1994

Research Paper 96/113
The site is too complicated for scientists to work out if it is safe.
Nirex don\'t know where all the fractures are that could take water back to the surface
from the dump, or how fast water will flow through them and the numerous different
rock types. Only one connective fracture is required to supply a radioactive spring
to the surface.
Water will flow from the waste towards the surface and fractures provide fast flow
routes.
Radioactive water could reach the surface long before it is safe.
The proposed dump is below a sandstone aquifer that is an important water resource.
Future generations could dig a well and pump up radioactive water to drink.
In other countries the site would be excluded from consideration for a deep dump. The
increased radiation risks to the public and environment due to such poor site selection are
impossible to quantify. The risk to individuals of death from cancer due to leaking
radioactive substance is likely to be far higher than at other sites, and is known with even less
certainty. The UK government, far from dealing with the problems, has recently proposed
weakening the regulations, so that the current risk limit no longer has to be met.
The proposed weakening of regulations is amplified by Greenpeace elsewhere28:
Weakening Standards. The Government is proposing to weaken standards of protection from
man-made radiation sources. Current regulations (the 1984 Green Book) state that the risk of
fatal cancer in an individual due to all man made sources, excluding medical, should not
exceed 1 in 100,000 in any one year. This led to a dose limit of 1 milli-sievert for an
individual. It is now believed that the risk of death associated with this dose (1 milli-sievert)
is five times higher - 1 death in 20,000. So rather than change the dose limits to correct the
mistake and restore a risk of 1 in 100,000 the current proposal is to keep the limit the same
and accept five times the risk.  New dose limits should be defined to correct the mistake
made.
In the conclusion to its closing submission to the public inquiry Greenpeace summarised its
reasons for recommending that the application for the RCF at Longlands Farm be refused as
follows29:

(a) the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development will meet its stated purpose.
It is highly unlikely, if not impossible, in Greenpeace\'s view that the RCF will ever
sufficiently characterise the site for a Detailed Safety Assessment to be made;
(b) alternatively, if the RCF could achieve its purpose, which is unlikely, then it will become
an integral part to the development of a Deep Waste Repository (DWR). However, one
cannot be confident that the Nirex approach so far will provide the greatest measure of
radiological safety to the public, and the significant economic commitment to the site at this
stage may lead to greater risks;
(c) Nirex has failed to provide any reliable assessments of results of its investigation
programme so far. It is therefore not possible to determine what benefits, if any, could be
gained from obtaining additional information from the RCF;
(d) alternative sites exist which appear to offer significantly better levels of safety. It is
imperative whilst disposal remains Government policy, that those sites are fully investigated
if there is to be any development of a DWR in the UK.
B. Friends of the Earth
FOE, on the other hand, is not opposed to disposal in principle. Its aim is to ensure a
sustainable policy for both energy and the radioactive waste that results 30:
1.2 Within FOE, the Energy, Nuclear and Climate Campaign, which was launched in
1973, is one of its longest running campaigns. Its principal aim is to promote a safe
and sustainable energy policy at all levels of energy supply and use, both in the UK
and internationally. The second of the Campaign\'s goals is to ensure that "the
radioactive legacy resulting from the use of nuclear power is managed and passed on
to future generations in the least environmentally damaging way possible."
FOE is not opposed in principle to the proposed RCF, but considers the planning application
to be premature31:
"Within the staged development of a nuclear waste repository construction of a Rock
Characterisation Facility will be required. However, it is critically important that RCF
construction is not undertaken prematurely." FOE\'s case demonstrates that the current
application is premature.

Research Paper 96/113
Its Statement of Case at the Inquiry is more specific about the scientific investigations
required before a planning application is made32:
"FOE contends, and will call evidence to show, that by carrying out an inadequate site
selection exercise Nirex has selected a site for the RCF which is geologically complex and has
a complicated groundwater flow pattern about which it still has an inadequate understanding.
FOE will show that because of the damage that proceeding with the RCF would cause
planning permission should not be granted for the RCF until such time as Nirex has gained
an adequate appreciation of the full nature and complexities of the site. FOE further contends
that to proceed with the RCF before adequate investigations have been carried out, will render
a properly justified decision about whether the site is suitable for a repository much more
difficult to take and may make it impossible."
C. Other Groups
The Consortium of Opposing Local Authorities (COLA) which bases its case largely upon
the studies by FOE, the Royal Society and HMIP, is opposed to the deep repository near
Sellafield for safety reasons33.
Cumbria County Council has also concluded that there is a significant likelihood that a
safety case for the development of a repository at Sellafield cannot be made and that it is "a
poor site chosen for the wrong reasons"34. It argues that there is a clear alternative to the
Sellafield site known as Site 6 in Nirex evidence. This is in eastern Europe35:
The County Council believes that the decision by the Nirex Board to reject this alternative
site, which is geologically and radiologically superior to Sellafield, was unsound and that it
is not sensible to enter into the commitment that the RCF represents when this alternative still
merits serious investigation.

VIII. Deep disposal in geological formations in other
countries
Deep geological disposal for HLW, spent fuel (which is classed as HLW), and ILW of long
half-life is considered to be safe and is a feature of radioactive waste management polices in
many countries. In fact every western country with a significant nuclear programme operates
or is planning for deep geological disposal. In comparison with other countries, the UK\'s
policy for such a disposal route for ILW and some LLW would seem conservative.
The design of individual facilities vary and are determined largely by the geology of the site.
In many countries the use of in situ investigation facilities, such as boreholes or an
underground research laboratory (URL) similar to the RCF are a preliminary to the final
design process for a repository.
In a number of countries repositories have been located in existing underground mines where
there are already in situ laboratories (Germany). In some countries where site selection has
not been finalised a \'reference\' URL (i.e. at a trial site) is considered suitable (Canada and
Japan). Other countries may construct a URL at a later stage of the process for site selection
(France and USA), whilst others may not require a URL at all (Finland).
The position in a number of countries was fully described in Nuclear Energy36 early in 1994
from which the following extracts are taken:
Germany
Germany intends to dispose of all its radioactive wastes (and, separately, its toxic wastes) in
deep geological formations. Prior to reunification, East Germany used the abandoned
Bartensleben salt mine, near the town of Morsleben, as a repository for LLW and ILW. Some
450m deep, it has a capacity of 15,000 cubic metres and began operation in 1979. Recently,
the German courts granted permission for its continued operation until the year 2000, when
a new licence will be sought. There had been some concern over its operations but on
examination by the West Germany radio-active waste disposal agency, DBE, these were not
found to be wanting.
The former iron ore mine at Konrad in Lower Saxony will, if found suitable, become the
repository for all non-heat generating wastes. It lies at depths of between 800-1300m,
overlain by clay. A decision on the commencement of waste emplacement is expected by
mid-1994.
                                                                                                                                                                           
36
 Nuclear Energy: Special Issue - The Nirex Repository, February 1994

Research Paper 96/113
The Gorleben repository, also in Lower Saxony, will take all wastes including heat-generating
and spend fuel. The intended depth is about 900m in a salt dome underlying a gypsum rock
cap. Shaft sinking started in 1986 and extensive underground tests to determine the
geological structure and draw up the detailed repository design are due to be completed in the
late 1990s. Construction is due to start at that time with the repository becoming operational
in 2008.
Research and development into disposal in salt has been carried out at the former Asse salt
mine since 1965 at depths of down to 1000m. Demonstrations of LLW and ILW disposal
were carried out until 1978 but work recently had focused on HLW disposal.
France 
France has a significant spent-fuel reprocessing industry and spent fuel is regarded as a
resource. It is committed through legislation to research deep disposal of long-lived wastes
in rock laboratories at two candidate sites. The selection programme for these was announced
in March 1992 and the choice of potential sites may be announced later this year. It is
intended to ensure that a range of options will be available when disposal decisions are made
in about 15 years time. This will necessitate a change in the law. Given a favourable
decision by the Government, a 400-1000m deep repository is intended at one of the URL
sites
USA
Deep geological disposal is the method chosen by the USA for TRU37 waste and HLW. A
waste isolation pilot plant (WIPP) for a defence TRU waste repository in a salt formation is
located in New Mexico at a depth of 700m. The 1985 Nuclear Waste Policy Act gave the go
ahead for the search of potential sites for a deep repository to take HLW and civilian TRU
waste. In 1987 the law was amended to direct the US Department of Energy to evaluate only
the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. Site characterization began in July 1991 and construction
of a URL (known here as the Experimental Studies Facility or ESF) has now started. Should
the site prove acceptable, a licence application will be made to construct a repository. The
earliest waste emplacement operations would begin is 2010. The Department of Energy is
intending to build a monitorable retrievable store (MRS) to serve as a holding facility until
the repository is ready. No site for this has yet been identified, but it is hoped that a State
or Indian Tribe will volunteer to host an MRS.
Belgium
Belgium, which has some of its fuel reprocessed, intends to dispose of its HLW and alpha-
bearing wastes in a deep-clay formation at Mol-Dessel nuclear site. A 230m deep URL has
been in operation there since 1984 (known as HADES and part-financed by the EC). Should
experiments in the URL show the site to be satisfactory, it is intended to begin repository

fission products is used.

Research Paper 96/113
construction in 2030 and commence disposal in 2040, subject of course to a successful
licensing process.
Canada
The Canadian concept is that HLW disposal should be in stable granite formations of the
Canadian Shield at a depth of between 500-1000m. A major component of the disposal
programme is the URL at Lac du Bonnet batholith near the Whiteshell Laboratories at Pinawa,
Manitoba, 100km from Winnipeg. Excavation of this commenced in 1986 and is now below
400m. It is not intended that Whiteshell becomes the eventual repository, but it will provide
the geological characterization methodology for candidate sites.
A very lengthy environmental assessment of a generic repository design is required prior to
the submission of the proposal for a site-specific facility. Subject to this, it is planned to have
an actual repository operational by 2025.
Japan
Since 1977, the Japanese have been running a site selection procedure for a deep repository.
A number of underground experiments have been carried out at existing quarries, an uranium
mine and other underground facilities. A dedicated URL on the north island is intended, but
adoption of a new policy in 1992 means that this will not be the final repository. HLW
disposal will not take place for may decades to come.
Spain
Spain commenced an HLW repository site selection programme in 1986 - a final choice is to
be made by the year 2000. Construction is planned to start in 2015 leading to a repository
operational date of 2020. Generic design are being considered for a repository in salt, granite
and clay formations; two have been developed. When a decision has been made by the
Government on the rock type to be used, an initial validation laboratory will be excavated, but
this would not necessarily be the repository site.
Finland
In Finland, after an initial screening exercise for a spent-fuel repository in the mid-1980s, five
sites were chosen for preliminary investigation. This was completed at the end of 1992 and
three of these have now been designated for detailed field studies to the year 2000. One site
will then be chosen for supplementary investigations until 2010. A licence application will
follow with commissioning planned for the year 2020. This repository will take the fuel from
Olkiluoto. The fuel from the Soviet-built Loviisa power station will be returned to Russia
for reprocessing, but there is no intention for any associated wastes to be returned to Finland.
Sweden
Between 1980 and 1992, Sweden ran an international URL project in a 400m deep abandoned
iron-ore mine at Stripa. The project was wound down and a new project begun below the
24


Research Paper 96/113
island of Äspö. This is planned to continue until the year 2010. Construction of the access
tunnel commenced in 1990 and is currently below 200m, with an eventual depth of 500m.
Sweden began looking for a final deposal site for HLW in 1977. Eight sites have been
studied closely and two or three sites are due to be selected this year for more detailed
characterization. A final selection will be made at the end of the century with the intention
of starting spent-fuel disposal in 2008 - two years ahead of the planned date for reactor
closure, decided following a referendum. A repository at Äspö, incorporating laboratory
excavations, is unlikely. However this would not preclude the choice of another site in the
region.
Switzerland
The Swiss intended to reprocess some fuel in France and the UK. They will dispose of the
returned waste in a 1200m deep HLW repository, which will be ready for operation by 2020.
The site selection programme is at present looking at four sites in the north of the country,
with one being selected for further detailed characterization in 1997. A deep URL will be
constructed at that location. In the meantime, since 1984, underground experiments have been
carried out at the Grimsel test site in the Alps, but this will not be a repository location. The
facility is situated about 1km inside the mountain which provides a 450m rock overburden.
