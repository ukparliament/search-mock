Since then the boundaries of the \nDarlington constituency have gradually extended to reflect the growth of the town of \nDarlington.  The parts of the modern constituency that were at one time beyond the \nboundaries, particularly in the nineteenth century, formed part of the county constituencies \nsurrounding Darlington.  The boundaries of the Darlington constituency have changed very \nlittle since 1950.  The latest boundary changes following the Fifth Periodical Review of \nParliamentary constituencies in England, implemented at the 2010 general election, \ntransferred approximately 670 voters from the Sedgefield constituency to the Darlington \nconstituency. \n \n \n \nSince the Second World War the Darlington constituency has returned mostly Labour MPs.  \nThe exceptions were when Conservative MPs were returned between 1951 and 1964 (Sir \nFergus Graham 1951-1959 and Anthony Bourne-Arton 1959-1964) and from 1983 to 1992 \n(Michael Fallon).  Between 1950 to 1997 the constituency was won by more than 5,000 votes \non only one occasion.  In 1992 Alan Milburn won the seat from Michael Fallon by 2,798 \n(Fallon went on to become the MP for Sevenoaks, in Kent).  Milburn held the seat at the \nthree subsequent elections and the seat is generally regarded as a safe Labour seat at the \nmoment. \nIn his Parliamentary career Alan Milburn was a front bench spokesman for the Labour Party \nfrom 1995 until 1997.  Following Labour’s general election victory in 1997 he was appointed \na Minister of State at the Department of Health.  The following year he was promoted to the \n3 \n\n\nCabinet and held three different posts, including Health Secretary, before resigning as a \nMinister in 2005.  In June 2009 he announced his intention not to seek re-election to the \nHouse of Commons at the next general election to “pursue challenges other than politics”.1 \nAt the 2010 general election the Darlington constituency was won by Jenny Chapman of the \nLabour Party.  She won with a majority of 3,388 votes. \n2 Early Representation \nUnlike many of the ancient counties, the people of Durham were not directly represented in \nParliament until the sixteenth century, in the reign of Henry VIII.  Parliaments of the knights of \nthe shires were summoned by the Monarch from the thirteenth century.  It was these \nParliaments summoned by writ to meet that were generally regarded as the first assemblies \nof representatives.2  County Durham was a County Palatine.  This is defined as “county or \nother territory in England…as having a ruler with royal privileges and judicial authority (within \nthe territory) which elsewhere belong to the sovereign alone”.3  Durham’s status as a County \nPalatine dates back to the Norman period and the power was held by the Bishops of Durham \nwho had the title Prince Bishop to denote the royal authority they exercised.  The Prince \nBishop held civil and military power and established courts and issued money.  Part of the \nreason for these special privileges was the proximity to Scotland and the remoteness from \nthe Monarch.  In an emergency the Prince Bishop could act to protect the county without \ndelay.4   \nCounty Durham appears in the returns twice in the Parliaments of 1654 and 1656.  These \nwere the Protectorate Parliaments that followed Oliver Cromwell’s Instrument of Government \nthat declared Cromwell Lord Protector.  The Instrument was an attempt to redistribute seats \non a more equitable basis.5  Durham’s representation was suspended following the \nRestoration in 1660 and power returned to the Prince Bishop but Members were again \nreturned to the Parliament of 1661 summoned by Charles II.  An Act of Parliament in 1672 \nconfirmed both the city and county of Durham’s representation in the English Parliament from \n1678.6  The returns for Durham for Cromwell’s Parliament summoned in 1654 did not survive \nbut the two county Members from the 1656 Parliament are named as Thomas Lilburne and \nJames Clavering.7  The pattern of representation remained unaltered until the reforms of \n1832, with four Members returned to Parliament, two to represent the county and two to \nrepresent the city of Durham. \n3 Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Changes \n3.1 Great Reform Act of 1832 \nThe Representation of the People Act 1832 was the Act that reformed the distribution of \nseats in England and Wales. It introduced the principle of splitting the shire counties into \ndivisions and returning two Members for each division rather than for the whole county and it \nalso reformed the Parliamentary boroughs that were entitled to send Members to \n \n \n1  Gaby Hinsliff, The Observer, June 2009, p13 \n2  House of Commons Information Office, Factsheet G3 A Brief Chronology of the House of Commons. \n3  http://dictionary.oed.com/entrance.dtl accessed 22 April 2008. \n4  Robert Surtees, History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham, 1816-40, ppxv-xvii \n5  Ivan Roots, The Great Rebellion 1642-1660, 1995, pp181-9 \n6  J Holladay Philbin, Parliamentary Representation 1832: England and Wales, 1965, pp67-70 \n7  House of Commons, Returns of Parliament Vol I 1213-1702, Ordered to be printed 1 March 1878 \n4 \n\n\nParliament.8  The City of Durham retained its status as a Parliamentary borough with the \nright to return two Members.  In addition Sunderland was established as a two Member \nParliamentary borough, and Gateshead and South Shields became single Member \nParliamentary boroughs.  Darlington was not granted separate Parliamentary representation. \nDurham was divided into two divisions, each of which returned two MPs.  The Boundary \nCommission proposals that followed the Act, published in 1832, made recommendations on \nthe boundaries of the Parliamentary boroughs and divisions of counties that had been listed \nin Schedule F.9  The recommendations of the Boundary Commission were implemented by \nthe Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832.10  These changes gave the county a total of ten \nseats in the reformed House of Commons.  This was an increase of six from the pre-1832 \narrangements. \nThe county was already divided into four wards and the Boundary Commission decided to \nuse them to split the county.  The Northern division of the county comprised the Chester and \nEasington wards, with the Southern division comprised of the Darlington and Stockton wards.  \nBoth divisions of the county were exclusive of the areas included within the four \nParliamentary boroughs.  They also excluded the isolated parts of Durham that lay between \nNewcastle and Berwick.  Those areas, Norhamshire, Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire were \nannexed to Northumberland for the purposes of Parliamentary representation.  This meant \nthat Darlington was represented by the two MPs for the Southern division of the county of \nDurham after 1832. \n3.2 Boundary Commission Review 1868 \nThe 1868 review carried out by the Boundary Commission followed the Representation of the \nPeople Act 1867. This Act appointed the Commission to inquire into the boundaries of the \nnew boroughs created by the Act; the counties the Act had newly divided, and to review all \nother existing boroughs that had not been disenfranchised by the Act. In inquiring into \nexisting boroughs, the Commissioners had the power to recommend extension of borough \nboundaries if it thought this was appropriate. This Act also increased the number of Members \nrepresenting each of the growing industrial cities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and \nLiverpool, from two to three.11 The Commissioners conducted local inquiries and reported in \n1868. \nIn county Durham none of the existing Parliamentary boroughs were abolished and the \nnumbers of seats in these boroughs were left unchanged.  The city of Durham and \nSunderland had their boundaries extended but South Shields was unaltered.  Three new \nParliamentary boroughs were created:  Darlington, the Hartlepools, and Stockton.  All three \nwere designated single Member boroughs.   \nThe two county divisions remained unaltered except for those areas that had been absorbed \ninto the extended or newly created Parliamentary boroughs.  This meant that the total \nnumber of Members in the county increased to thirteen as a result of the creation of the three \nnew boroughs. \nThe new Parliamentary borough of Darlington was temporarily defined as comprising the \ntownships of Darlington, Haughton-le-Skerne, and Cockerton by the RPA 1867.  However, \n \n \n8  Representation of the People Act 1832, (2 Will 4, chapter 45) \n9  Parliamentary Representation Boundary Reports in Eighteen Volumes, 1831-2 \n10  Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832 (2 and 3 Will 4 chapter 64) \n11  Representation of the People Act 1867 (30 and 31 Vict chapter 102) \n5 \n\n\nthe Boundary Act 1868, which implemented any alterations resulting from the Boundary \nCommission inquiries, defined the Parliamentary borough of Darlington as being the same as \nthe municipal borough of Darlington.12  This excluded Cockerton and Haughton.  It also \nexcluded Blackwell in the south.  The western boundary was Baydale Beck, with Cocker \nBeck forming the north western boundary.  In the north east the river Skerne marked the \nborough boundary and the northern limit of the borough, along the North Road, was \napproximately where Thompson Street is today.  The southern boundary approximated to the \nmodern route of Consicliffe Road in the west but extended further south in the east to include \nthe area around the modern location of Darlington Cricket Club.  A small area of Oxen-le-\nFields was administratively part of Darlington but was excluded from the Parliamentary \nborough. \nThe boundaries of Darlington implemented in 1868 meant that some parts of the modern \nconstituency lay beyond the boundary.  These areas continued to be represented by the two \nMPs for the Southern division of the county of Durham. \n3.3 Boundary Commission Review 1885 \nThe next review occurred in 1885. In major cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham \nthere was a major change to the distribution of seats. Until now these had been \nparliamentary boroughs returning multiple members. The Redistribution of Seats Bill made \nprovision for larger boroughs to be divided into single Member divisions. A Boundary \nCommission was established to recommend boundaries while the Bill was still going through \nParliament. The Commission was appointed in November 1884 and reported in February \n1885.13 The recommendations were incorporated into the Bill which became the \nRedistribution of Seats Act 1885.14 \nThere were two alterations to the Parliamentary boroughs in the county of Durham.  Durham \ncity was reduced to a single Member seat and the borough of Darlington had its boundaries \naltered. \nThe Act also altered representation in many of the counties.  Several counties were divided \ninto single Member divisions. Durham was one such county and the Act divided the areas of \nthe county not included in Parliamentary boroughs into eight divisions.  This gave the county \na total of sixteen Members, a net increase of three.  The constituencies created contained a \nmix of petty sessional divisions and parishes.  Petty sessional divisions were the \ngeographical area of operation of magistrates’ courts within counties for the administration of \nlocal summary justice.  These have since been replaced by fewer and larger modern petty \nsessional areas.15 \nThe borough boundaries of Darlington had not grown significantly so the area of the \nParliamentary borough saw only minor adjustment.  The areas not included in the borough \nformed part of a new constituency named South East Durham. \n \n \n12  Boundary Act 1868 ( 31 and 32 Vict chapter 46) \n13  Boundary Commission for England and Wales Report, C 4287, 1885 \n14  Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 (48 & 49 Vict chapter 23) \n15   Bryan Gibson, Introduction to the Magistrates’ Court, 4th Ed, 2001, pp14,17 \n6 \n\n\n3.4 Boundary Commission Review 1917 \nThe next Boundary Commission review reported in 1917,16 and the results were incorporated \ninto the Representation of the People Act 1918.17 The Act made many changes to \nconstituencies and elections in the UK. \nIn this review the Boundary Commission used local government administrative areas, as they \nexisted at the time, to construct constituencies.  There was also far less detail printed than in \nmodern reviews.  This makes direct comparison with other reviews difficult. \nIn Durham county, the city of Durham was abolished as a Parliamentary borough and was \nmerged into the county seats.  The other six boroughs were retained, with Sunderland \nretaining two Members and all the others each returning a single Member.  The county at \nlarge was divided into eleven single Member constituencies.  This gave the county a total of \neighteen seats. \nThe Parliamentary borough of Darlington was extended to include the whole of the municipal \nborough of Darlington, which had grown since the 1885 review.  The borough had been \nextended to include most of Cockerton and parts of Haughton, although most of Haughton \nremained as a separate parish.  This meant that an increased area of the modern \nconstituency was within the boundaries of the Parliamentary borough created by this review.  \nThe areas not included in the borough, including the parish of Haughton, formed part of a \nnew constituency named Sedgefield. \n4 Boundary Commission Periodical Reviews \nThe regular reviews of Parliamentary constituencies have their origins in the House of \nCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944. This Act instructed the Boundary Commission \nfor England to conduct an initial review of all seats with a view to keeping them under \nconstant review. One of the Rules in this review was that all two Member boroughs should be \ndivided and return a single Member for each division unless the Commission felt it \n“undesirable to divide it”. The recommendations of the initial review were published in \n1947.18 This formed the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1948.19 The following \nyear the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 was passed, which repealed \nthe 1944 Act, but took the principle of periodic review forward and established the rules for \nthe reviews. 20  \n \nIn county Durham the situation in the Parliamentary boroughs remained largely unaltered.  \nThe only real difference was that Sunderland was split into two single Member constituencies \nrather than the whole borough returning two Members, as had been the case since 1832.  \nThe other five Parliamentary boroughs continued to be single Member constituencies.  The \nremaining parts of the county were divided into ten single Member constituencies.  This was \na reduction of one. \nBy the time of the Initial Review the borough of Darlington had grown again.  The boundaries \nof the constituency of Darlington were adjusted to make them coterminous with the borough.  \nIt meant that the constituency boundaries were recognisable as those that still exist today.  \n \n16  Boundary Commission (England & Wales) Report and Appendices, Cd 8756, 1917 \n17  Representation of the People Act 1918, (7 & 8 Geo V, chapter 64) \n18  Boundary Commission for England Constituted in accordance with the House of Commons (Redistribution of \nSeat) Act 1944 Initial Report, Cmd 7260, October 1947 \n19  Representation of the People Act 1948, (11 & 12 Geo 6, chapter 65) \n20  The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 (12 & 13 Geo 6 chapter 66) \n7 \n\n\nThe maps provided with the earlier reviews are not sufficiently detailed to draw exact \nconclusions but only a small number of electors currently in the Darlington constituency \nwould have been beyond the constituency boundary at this time.  The area surrounding \nDarlington was again allocated to the Sedgefield constituency. \n4.1 First Periodical Review \nThe first full periodical review followed in 1953-4 with the report published in 1954.21  This \nreview divided the Gateshead constituency and altered the Jarrow constituency.  The \nremaining fifteen constituencies were unaltered.  These new boundaries were first used in \nthe 1955 general election. \n4.2 Second Periodical Review \nThe Second Periodical Review was published in 1969, having commenced in February \n1965.22  Since the previous review the county borough of Teesside had been created.  This \ncovered the Redcar, Middlesborough, Stockton and Thornaby area and the borough was part \nof the North Riding of Yorkshire.  This meant Stockton was no longer considered part of \nDurham.  As a result the county was allocated one seat fewer than in the previous review, \ntaking the county total to sixteen \nThe Boundary Commission noted that a Royal Commission on local government in England \nwas likely to make major changes to the Tyneside area so the Commission decided to make \nas little alteration as possible to the Parliamentary constituency boundaries in this review.  \nThe Darlington constituency was adjusted to realign the constituency boundaries with the \nborough boundaries, which had been altered in 1967.  The Boundary Commission report \nnoted this as a minor change but gave no detail.  The area surrounding the Darlington \nconstituency was transferred to the Bishop Auckland constituency following the abolition of \nthe Sedgefield constituency. \nThe 1969 recommendations were not implemented until after the 1970 general election, so \nthe new boundaries were not used until the general elections of 1974. For more detail see \nResearch Paper 92/61 The Parliamentary Boundary Commissions and the Boundary \nCommissions Bill.  \n4.3 Third Periodical Review \nThe next periodical review commenced in 1976, and the report was published in 1983.23  \nSince the last review the Local Government Act 1972 had been implemented, which had \naltered many of the administrative boundaries across the country.  This had a significant \nimpact on the county of Durham.  The Tyneside areas of Gateshead, Jarrow and South \nShields, in the north of the county, were combined with Sunderland, Houghton and \nWashington and transferred to the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.  A new non-\nmetropolitan county of Cleveland was created southeast of Durham.  Hartlepool and the rural \ndistrict of Stockton were transferred to Cleveland.  The remainder of the old county of \nDurham was combined with the rural district of Startforth, in the old North Riding Yorkshire, to \ncreate a new county of Durham.24 \n \n \n21  Boundary Commission for England First Periodical Report, Cmd 9311, November 1954 \n22  Boundary Commission for England Second Periodical Report, Cmnd 4084, June 1969 \n23  Boundary Commission for England Third Periodical Report, Cmnd 8797, February 1983 \n24  Local Government Act 1972 (chapter 70) \n8 \n\n\nThe Act also revised the local administrative structure within the modified county.  It defined \nthe area covered by the county, but gave the Secretary of State for the Environment the \npower to define and name the new structure of local councils by order at a later date.  The \nmunicipal boroughs and rural districts were abolished and new districts were created using \nthe definitions contained in the English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972.25  \nThe existing borough of Darlington was merged with part of the surrounding rural district to \nform the new borough of Darlington.26  New local electoral wards were then implemented in \n1976.27 \nThe Boundary Commission allocated the modified county seven constituencies.  The \nBoundary Commission initially recommended that the Darlington constituency should be \nenlarged to include three of the five rural wards that now formed part of the new borough of \nDarlington, Hurworth, Middleton St George, and Sadberge as they existed at the time.  \nFollowing a local inquiry the proposal was dropped and the Darlington constituency was \nretained with the same boundaries as before and comprised all but five wards of the borough \nof Darlington.  The five rural wards of the borough of Darlington were instead allocated to the \nSedgefield constituency re-established as a result of this review.  The new boundaries were \nimplemented by order in 1983.28 They were used in the 1983, 1987 and 1992 general \nelections. \n4.4 Fourth Periodical Review \nThe Fourth Periodical Review commenced in February 1991 and reported to Parliament in \nJune 1995.29  Durham was allocated seven seats.  The Darlington constituency was \nunaltered by the review and continued to comprise all but five of the borough’s wards.  The \nfive rural wards remained allocated to the Sedgefield constituency although there were \nboundary changes elsewhere in the Sedgefield constituency.  These boundaries were \nimplemented by order in 199530, and used in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections. \n4.5 Fifth Periodical Review \nThe Fifth Periodical Review of constituencies in England commenced in February 2000 and \nwas published in February 2007.  The final recommendations adopted by the Commission \nand approved by Parliament were used at the 2010 general election. \nThere had been two significant developments in the county by the time of the Fifth Review.  \nAll the local government districts of the county had been re-warded in 1999 along with those \nof Darlington in 2001.31  The Boundary Commission had to realign boundaries to take into \naccount any alterations that had led to Parliamentary boundaries no longer being \ncoterminous with ward boundaries.  In addition the Durham (Borough of Darlington) \n(Structural Changes) Order 1995 had created the new unitary authority of Darlington, which \nnow had county status in its own right, and was no longer administratively part of the county \nof Durham.32 \n \n \n25  English Non-metropolitan District (Definition) Order 1972 SI 1972/2039 \n26  English Non-metropolitan District (Names) Order 1973 SI 1973/551 \n27   Borough of Darlington (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1976 SI 1976/832 \n28  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1983, SI 1983/417 \n29  Boundary Commission for England Fourth Periodical Report, Cm 433, 6 June 1995 \n30  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1995, SI 1995/1626 \n31  Borough of Darlington (Electoral Changes) Order 2001 SI 2001/3357 \n32  Durham (Borough of Darlington) (Structural Changes) Order 1995 SI 1995/1772 \n9 \n\n\nThe Boundary Commission decided to review county Durham and Darlington together.  They \nnoted that it would not affect the overall allocation of seats, but by reviewing the areas \ntogether the option of minimal changes would be available.  If Darlington had been reviewed \nas a separate review area this would have required greater disruption to Parliamentary \nboundaries. \nIn the Darlington constituency the Boundary Commission recommended that there should be \nminimal realignment to the constituency boundaries to take into account the new ward \nboundaries.  This required two alterations.  The Harrowgate Hill ward had been enlarged to \ntake in an area formerly in the Whessoe ward.  The Harrowgate ward remained allocated to \nthe Darlington constituency which meant that 375 electors were transferred from the \nSedgefield constituency to the Darlington constituency.  A new ward named Faverdale had \nbeen created and it too included an area formerly included in the Whessoe wards as well as \nincluding some of the old Cockerton East ward.  The Faverdale ward was allocated to the \nDarlington constituency which meant 295 electors were transferred to the Darlington \nconstituency. \nA local inquiry into the proposals for Durham and Darlington was required.  The principal \nissue in relation to Darlington was whether Darlington should be reviewed separately or as \npart of the combined review area.  If Darlington was reviewed as a single area it would \nproduce a single constituency coterminous with the borough.  The Assistant Commissioner \nconducting the inquiry reported that this would not necessarily produce an excessive \ndisparity in the electorates of the constituencies in Durham and Darlington but there was \nsignificant approval for the Commission’s initial recommendations to keep the four rural \nwards of Darlington in the Sedgefield constituency (the ward restructuring had reduced the \nnumber of wards covering the rural parts of Darlington from five to four).  The Assistant \nCommissioner therefore recommended that the Commission’s initial proposals for Darlington \nshould stand and be adopted as the final recommendation to be put to Parliament. \nThe draft Order approving the Boundary Commission’s final recommendations was laid \nbefore Parliament on 26 February 2007 and was subject to the affirmative procedure. The \nHouse of Commons considered the draft Order on 27 March 2007 in the Fourth Delegated \nLegislation Committee33 and was formally approved by the House on 16 April 2007.34  The \nHouse of Lords approved the draft Order on 17 May 200735 with the approved Order being \nmade on 13 June 2007 and coming into force 14 days after that.36  The full details of the \nprovisional recommendations and the local inquiry can be viewed on an archive of the \nBoundary Commission website.37 \n \n \n33  SC Deb (4DLC) 27 March 2007 c3-26 \n34  HC Deb 16 April 2007, c131-2 \n35  HL Deb 17 May 2007, c380-3 \n36  Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order  SI 2007/1681 \n37  http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100221151902/http://www.boundarycommissionforenglan \nd.org.uk/index.shtml \n10 \n\n\n5 Previous Members \nThe following lists give details of Members who have represented the area now broadly \ncovered by the constituency.38,39,40,41  For biographical details of Members pre-1979 see \nStenton and Lees’ various volumes.42 Biographical details of Members from 1979 – 2010 are \navailable in Research Paper 2010/33 Members 1979 - 2010.43 \n1832-1885 Southern Durham (County division with two seats) \nDates Election Members Party \n1832 General election Joseph Pease  \nJohn Bowes \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1835 General election John Bowes  \nJoseph Pease \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1837 General election John Bowes \nJoseph Pease \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1841 General election Lord Harry Vane \nJohn Bowes \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1847 General election James Farrer \nLord Harry Vane \nConservative \nLiberal \n1852 General election James Farrer \nLord Harry Vane \nConservative \nLiberal \n1857 General election Henry Pease \nLord Harry Vane \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1859 General election James Farrer \nHenry Pease \nConservative \nLiberal \n1865 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nCharles Surtees \nLiberal \nConservative \n \n \n38  FWS Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1932 – 1885, 1977; British Parliamentary Results 1885-\n1918, 1974;  British Parliamentary Election Results 1918 - 1949, 1983; British Parliamentary Election Results  \n1950 – 1973,  1983; British Parliamentary Election Results 1974 – 1983, 1984 \n39  Rallings and Thrasher, British Parliamentary Election Results 1983 – 1997, 1999, Britain Votes 6: British \nParliamentary Election Results, 1997, 1998 \n40  Electoral Commission, Election 2001: The Official Results, 2001 \n41  Times Guide to the House of Commons 2005, 2005 \n42  Stenton and Lees, Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament Volume I, 1832-1885, 1976; Who’s Who of \nBritish Members of Parliament Volume II 1886-1918, 1978;Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament \nVolume III 1919-1945, 1979 and Who’s Who of British Members of Parliament Volume IV1945-79, 1981 \n43  Oonagh Gay, House of Commons Library Research Paper 2010/33, Members 1979 - 2010 \n11 \n\n\n1868 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nFrederick Beaumont \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1874 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nFrederick Beaumont \nLiberal \nLiberal \n1880 General election Sir Joseph W Pease \nHon.

The information contained in this Note is no longer current, following the fall of the\nSaddam Hussein regime in April 2003. It provides historical information on the ‘no-fly\nzones’ over northern and southern Iraq, which were imposed by the USA and UK in the\naftermath of the Gulf War of 1991. The Note looks at the legal basis cited by Washington\nand London for the zones and summarises the main incidents that occurred between\nSeptember 2001 and March 2003.\nContents\nA. Background 2\nB. Debate over the Legal Basis 2\nC. Operations in the No-Fly Zones 5\nD. Summary of Activity since 11 September 2001 8\n\n\n2A. Background\nThe United States, the United Kingdom and France cited humanitarian reasons for the\nestablishment of the ‘no-fly zones’ over northern and southern Iraq, claiming the zones were\nrequired to help protect the Kurdish and Shi'ite populations from attack by Iraqi government\nforces at the end of the Gulf War.\nThe northern zone north of the 36th parallel was introduced in April 1991 as part of Operation\nProvide Comfort to provide humanitarian assistance to the Kurdish population in northern\nIraq. The no-fly zone operation, renamed Northern Watch in January 1997, involves\napproximately 45 aircraft from the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.\nMonitoring of the southern zone, called Operation Southern Watch, commenced in August\n1992, to help protect the Shi’ite population of southern Iraq. The zone initially covered the\narea south of the 32nd parallel. Following incursions by Iraqi forces into the Kurdish area in\n1996, the zone was extended northwards to the 33rd parallel.\nUS and British aircraft currently patrol the southern zone, which covers approximately one-\nthird of Iraq. France refused to participate in patrolling north of the 32nd parallel and halted\nall participation after Operation Desert Fox, the joint US-UK four-day campaign of air strikes\nagainst Iraq in December 1998.\nThe zones restrict Iraqi military activity in the north and south of the country by keeping\naircraft grounded, hindering the deployment of air defence radars and surface-to-air missiles\nand allowing the US and UK to monitor any large-scale deployments by Iraqi ground-forces.\nIraq rejects the zones, claiming they have no basis in UN Security Council Resolutions. An\nIraqi spokesman said on 5 January 1999:\nImposing the so-called no-fly zones is illegal…it is a flagrant violation of\ninternational laws, norms and charters, particularly the UN Charter. Moreover, it is a\nflagrant violation of the Security Council resolutions [which] underline the need to\nrespect Iraq's sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity.1\nB. Debate over the Legal Basis\nThe precise legal basis of the zones is the subject of some debate. British and American\nofficials point to Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991, which demands that Iraq\nend the repression of its civilian population and appeals to all Member States to contribute to\nhumanitarian relief efforts.2 Russia insists that the zones are not in fact backed by specific\nresolutions, arguing that Resolution 688 was not adopted under Chapter VII of the UN\nCharter, which concerns action with respect to threats to or breaches of international peace\n1 BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 7 January 1999\n2 S/RES/688 (1991)\n\n\n3and security, and which allows the Security Council to authorise the use of force. London\nand Washington hold that the zones remain of vital importance as a “necessary humanitarian\nmeasure” to deter further internal repression by Baghdad.3 It is argued that the Iraqi\ngovernment’s record of internal repression, such as the use of poison gas on Kurdish civilians\nin 1988, underlines the importance of maintaining the zones.\nThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Ben\nBradshaw, gave the following account of the no-fly zones in a Written Answer of 29 April\n2002.\nThe no-fly zones were established in support of UNSCR 688. This called on Iraq to\nend its brutal repression of Kurds and other minority groups in the north and of the\nShia community in the south. The no-fly zones were set up in response to a grave\nhumanitarian crisis and they prevent Saddam Hussein from once again using his air\npower against the civilian population in those areas.4\nThe full text of Resolution 688 is reproduced below:\nS/RES/0688 (1991)\n5 April 1991\nRESOLUTION 688 (1991)\nAdopted by the Security Council at its 2982nd meeting on 5 April 1991\nThe Security Council,\nMindful of its duties and its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security,\nRecalling the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter of the United\nNations,\nGravely concerned by the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of\nIraq, including most recently in Kurdish populated areas, which led to a massive flow\nof refugees towards and across international frontiers and to cross-border incursions,\nwhich threaten international peace and security in the region,\nDeeply disturbed by the magnitude of the human suffering involved,\nTaking note of the letters sent by the representatives of Turkey and France to the\nUnited Nations dated 2 April 1991 and 4 April 1991, respectively (S/22435 and\nS/22442),\n3 Financial Times, 2 February 1999\n4 HC Deb 29 April 2002, c581-2w\n\n\n4Taking note also of the letters sent by the Permanent Representative of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran to the United Nations dated 3 and 4 April 1991, respectively\n(S/22436 and S/22447),\nReaffirming the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and political independence of Iraq and of all States in the area,\nBearing in mind the Secretary-General's report of 20 March 1991 (S/22366),\n1. Condemns the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq,\nincluding most recently in Kurdish populated areas, the consequences of which\nthreaten international peace and security in the region;\n2. Demands that Iraq, as a contribution to remove the threat to international peace and\nsecurity in the region, immediately end this repression and express the hope in the\nsame context that an open dialogue will take place to ensure that the human and\npolitical rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected;\n3.

Operations in the No-Fly Zones\nIn a Written Answer on 17 December 1998, the then Secretary of State for Defence, George\nRobertson, stated:\nSince patrolling of the northern and southern Iraqi No-Fly-Zones began…the RAF\nhave flown some 15,500 sorties in the zones.6\nIn a further Written Answer on 5 June 2000, the then Parliamentary Under Secretary for\nDefence, John Spellar, outlined specific figures for the following year:\nBetween April 1999 and March 2000 RAF aircraft flew a total of 2,683 sorties in the\nno-fly zones; 450 in the northern no-fly zone and 2,233 in the southern no-fly zone.7\nWith regard to American involvement in the no-fly zones, Lt. Col. Phillip Gibbons of the\nWashington Institute for Near East Policy wrote on 1 July 2002 that:\nSince 1991, the United States has averaged over 34,000 military sorties per year in\nsupport of no-fly zone operations in Iraq.8\nThe cost to the UK of enforcing the individual no-fly zones was outlined in a Written Answer\non 16 February 1999 by the then Secretary of State for Defence, George Robertson:\nEnforcement of the northern and southern no-fly-zones over Iraq began in 1991 and\n1992 respectively. The annual additional costs of each operation since that time are as\nfollows:\n(£ million)\nYear North South\n1991-92 2.6 --\n1992-93 4.2 5.3\n1993-94 9.6 6.5\n1994-95 10.5 4.6\n1995-96 5.9 4.7\n1996-97 2.3 4.1\n1997-98 2.3 3.4\n1998-99 (1) 3.2 7.6\n6 HC Deb 17 December 1998 c652\n7 HC Deb 5 June 2000 c3w\n8 Lt.

The southern no-fly-zone estimate for this\nyear takes account of the deployment of RAF aircraft to Kuwait as well as Saudi\nArabia.9\nHowever, beyond 1999 more precise figures are unavailable. The Minister for the Armed\nForces, Adam Ingram, stated in a Written Answer on 7 November 2002:\nOur records do not separately identify expenditure incurred in maintaining the no fly\nzones. However, the table below sets out the overall additional expenditure incurred\nby the Ministry of Defence as a direct result of operations in the Gulf from 1992-1993\nonwards.\nYear Million\n1992-93 551\n1993-94 179\n1994-95 58\n1995-96 14\n1996-97 6\n1997-98 16\n1998-99 35\n1999-2000 28\n2000-01 25\n2001-02 (estimate) 221\n2002-03 (estimate) 261\nNote: 1 denotes figure calculated on a resource basis; all previous figures are cash-\nbased.\nI will write to my hon. Friend concerning expenditure in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003\nand a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.10\nSince 1998 there has been an increase in military activity by coalition aircraft operating in the\nnorthern and southern no-fly zones. The United States European Command has stated:\nCoalition aircraft have been enforcing the northern no-fly-zone for more than 10\nyears. Since December 1998, Saddam Hussein has opted to challenge this\nenforcement by firing at coalition aircraft with surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and\nanti-aircraft artillery and by targeting them with radar…aircraft respond in self-\ndefence to these threats, while continuing to enforce the no-fly-zones.11\n9 HC Deb 16 February 1999 c610W\n10 HC Deb 7 November 2002, c468W\n11 United States European Command, Operation Northern Watch website.

There’s been a sporadic war occurring in the air over Iraq for a dozen years\nnow. This merely ratchets up the intensity”.12\nIn response to these allegations the Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, stated during\nOral Questions on 3 March 2003:\nAs I said a few moments ago, our forces have been undertaking more frequent patrols\nin the no-fly zones with a broader range of aircraft. However, I assure my hon. Friend\nthat they do that in response to efforts to attack them and act entirely in self-defence,\nin accordance with international law […] the arrangements for patrolling the southern\nand northern no-fly zones remain unchanged. As he would expect, our forces are\nauthorised to deal with any threats that Iraqi forces pose to them.13\n12\n“Allies bomb key Iraqi targets: ‘Undeclared war’ enters new phase”, The Guardian, 3 March 2003\n13 HC Deb 3 March 2003, c565\n\n\n8D.

This paper considers the background to and provisions of the Bill, which\narises from measures proposed by the Government in response to the report of The Public\nInquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 Cm 3386. The\ninquiry was chaired by Lord Cullen and published on October 16 1996. The Bill does not\nextend to Northern Ireland. \nMary Baber\nHome Affairs Section\nHouse of Commons Library\n\n\nSummary\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Bill [Bill 10 of 1996-97] is designed to implement proposals set\nout in the Government's response to the report of the public inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen\ninto the shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996. The intention behind the\nBill is to ban handguns above .22 calibre and permit members of the public to own handguns\ntaking .22 rimfire cartridges, provided that these are stored in secure conditions in gun clubs\nlicensed under new procedures. There will be limited exemptions for certain categories of\npeople, including vets who need to put down animals humanely, people who work in\nslaughterhouses, race officials at athletic meetings and people with trophies of war obtained\nbefore 1946. Other provisions in the Bill are also aimed at tightening the current certification\nprocedures carried out by the police, placing the onus on individuals to satisfy the police that\nthey are fit to hold a firearm safely and giving the police powers to revoke certificates where\nthey consider that the applicant no longer has good reason for possessing a firearm. The Bill\nalso contains provisions brought forward by the Government in addition to those covered by\nLord Cullen, including a ban on expanding ammunition except for the purposes of lawfully\nshooting deer and vermin control, a curb on mail order sales of firearms and a requirement\nfor gun owners to inform the police if they buy, sell, destroy, transfer or de-activate any gun.\nThis paper sets out a brief history of gun control in this country and goes on to describe the\ncurrent controls and certification procedures under the Firearms Act 1968 as amended and\nhow these will be affected by the Bill. It also explains the current approval procedures for gun\nclubs and the provisions in the Bill under which the clubs will have to be licensed.\nThe Government has said that compensation will be paid to owners of guns which are to be\nprohibited by the Bill, based on the market value of the guns before October 16th 1996.\nLicensed firearms dealers will also be compensated for stocks of prohibited weapons which\nthey wish to surrender.This paper discusses the question of compensation for firearms and the\nuse of firearms amnesties.\nIt has been asserted by some commentators that the Bill of Rights 1689 may affect statutory\nattempts at gun control. This paper considers these assertions and the wider discussion about\nthe current status of the 1689 Bill. \nThis paper includes a brief summary of controls on firearms in Northern Ireland, although the\nFirearms (Amendment ) Bill does not extend there.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nA.

Brief outline of the history of the control of firearms in Great\nBritain\nBefore the Firearms Act 1920, there was virtually no control over the sale and possession of\nguns. In his evidence to the Home Affairs Committee in 1996, the specialist adviser, Mr\nColin Greenwood, commented that:1\nDuring the early part of this century anyone, respectable citizen, criminal or lunatic, could\nwalk into a gunshop and buy any firearm he wanted. The law prohibited sales to persons who\nwere drunk at the time, and those wishing to buy a pistol would have been required to call\nfirst at a post office to obtain a 10 shilling licence. Despite that, statistics provided by the\nCommissioner of Police for the Metropolis showed that the use of it in crime was very rare\nindeed.\nThe 1920 Act, passed at a time of concern about the quantities of weapons available after the\nfirst World War, made it an offence to buy, possess, use or carry rifles and pistols or their\nammunition without a certificate from a chief officer of police, who had to be sure that an\napplicant had a good reason for acquiring the firearm and could be permitted to have it\nwithout danger to public safety. The Firearms Amendment Act 1936 strengthened\narrangements for the issue of certificates by enabling conditions to be attached to them;\nbrought weapons such as short-barrelled shot guns within the control and prescribed stringent\ncontrols on continuous fire weapons such as machine guns. Shotguns remained outside the\nsystem of controls.\nIn 1962 the Air Guns and Shot Guns Etc. Act restricted the use of such weapons by young\npersons. The Firearms Act 1965, described by Mr Greenwood as \"...clearly a panic reaction\nto the abolition of the death penalty\"2, substantially increased the penalties for offences\ninvolving firearms and created new offences of carrying firearms in public places or while\ntrespassing.\nPart V of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 made it an offence to buy or possess a shot gun\nwithout a certificate issued by a chief officer of police, but there was no requirement to have\na good reason for wanting one. This, and all previous legislation on the control of firearms\nin England, Scotland and Wales was consolidated in the Firearms Act 1968.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 1995-96 HC 393-II p.109\n2 ibid, p.110\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nIn 1973, a consultative document was issued by the Home Office which made wide-ranging\nproposals based on the report of Sir John McKay's working party set up in 1970. Mr\nGreenwood, in his memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee, commented that the first\nconclusion of the unpublished report that a reduction in the number of firearms in private\nhands was a desirable end in itself, was not included in the green paper.3\nThis proposed that self-loading rifles and pump-action and repeater shot guns should be\nmoved into the prohibited category and that additions should be able to be made by order;\nthat another order-making power should be introduced to achieve greater consistency in\ndeciding what was a good reason for possessing \"Section 1\" firearms, but the most far-\nreaching of suggested changes were those relating to shot guns which, it proposed, should be\nsubject to the same controls as rifles and pistols under s.1 of the 1968 Act. The proposal met\nwith considerable opposition from the shooting community and time was not found for the\nnecessary legislation.\nIn 1987, the tragic events at Hungerford which resulted in the deaths of 16 people killed by\na single gunman precipitated further consideration of changes to the 1968 Act. The gunman,\nMichael Ryan, was lawfully entitled to posses the following self-loading weapons:4\nBeretta 9 mm pistol\nBernadelli .22 pistol\nCZ OR50 .32 pistol\nKalashnikov 7.62 mm rifle\nUnderwood Carbine .30 rifle\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 provided, inter alia\n a prohibition on high powered self-loading rifles\n a prohibition on burst fire weapons and repeating short barrelled smooth bore guns\n that pump action and self-loading short guns with a magazine capacity in excess of 2 shots\nbe brought under the same control as rifles and pistols \n that prohibited weapons converted from a higher classification to a lower one, should retain\nthe original higher classification.\n that the onus was on the applicant for a certificate to show that he could be permitted to\npossess a shotgun without danger to the public safety or the peace and\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 1995-96; HC 393-II, p.110\n4 11.2.88 HC Deb 127 c.306W\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n the power for the chief officer to refuse to grant or renew a certificate if satisfied that the\napplicant did not have good reason for possessing a shotgun.\nThe Firearms Rules 1989, SI 1989/854 set out inter alia new requirements for the safekeeping\nof shotguns, as did the Firearms (Scotland) Rules in Scotland, SI 1989/889. S.22 of the Act\nestablished a firearms consultative committee to keep under review the working of the\nFirearms Acts.\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1994 created new criminal offences of using a firearm or\nimitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and made it clear that the offence of\ntrespassing with a firearm can be committed when using an imitation firearm.\nThe controls in Northern Ireland imposed by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 are\ndescribed on p.77.\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nB. Controls on Firearms - Part I of the Bill\n1. General Principles, Definitions and Current Controls\nThe underlying purpose of firearms legislation in the UK is to control the supply and\npossession of all rifles, guns and pistols which could be used for criminal or subversive\npurposes while recognising that individuals may own and use firearms for legitimate purposes.\nThe possession of pistols, revolvers, rifles and ammunition for these weapons has required\na police firearm certificate since the implementation of the Firearms Act 1920 and shotguns\nhave required a police certificate since 1967. Machine guns have been prohibited wapons\nsince 1937. The principal Act in England and Wales and Scotland is the Firearms Act 1968,\nas amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and others. \nFor the purposes of the Firearms Acts 1968-1992, \"firearm\" means \"a lethal barrelled weapon\nof any description from which any shot, bullet or missile can be discharged...\"5 The Firearms\nAct 1982 extended the definition of \"firearm\" to include some imitation firearms. \nControls of varying degrees are placed on four broad categories of weapons under the\nFirearms Acts. These categories are: \nProhibited Weapons\nSome types of weapon and ammunition are prohibited altogether and may only lawfully be\nheld in someone's possession, purchased, acquired, manufactured, sold or transferred with the\nauthority of the Secretary of State. The full list is set out in Section 5(1) of the Firearms Act\n1968 as follows:\n(a) any firearm which is so designed or adapted that two or more missiles\ncan be successively discharged without repeated pressure on the\ntrigger;\n(ab) any self-loading or pump-action rifle other than one which is\nchambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges;\n(ac) any self-loading or pump-action smooth-bore gun which is not\nchambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges and either has a barrel less than\n24 inches in length or (excluding any detachable, folding, retractable\nor other movable butt-stock) is less than 40 inches in length overall;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Firearms Act 1968 Section 57 (i)\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n(ad) any smooth-bore revolver gun other than one which is chambered for\n9 mm rim-fire cartridges or loaded at the muzzle end of each chamber;\n(ae) any rocket launcher, or any mortar, for projecting a stabilised missile,\nother than a launcher or mortar designed for line-throwing or\npyrotechnic purposes or as signalling apparatus;\n(b) any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the\ndischarge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing; and\n[(c) any cartridge with a bullet designed to explode on or immediately\nbefore impact, any ammunition containing or designed or adapted to\ncontain any such noxious thing as is mentioned in paragraph (b) above\nand, if capable of being used with a firearm of any description, any\ngrenade, bomb (or other like missile), or rocket or shell designed to\nexplode as aforesaid].\nParagraphs a)-ae) and paragraph c) of this subsection were introduced by the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 in the wake of the massacre at Hungerford in the summer of 1987.\nUnder Section 5A of the 1968 Act the possession, purchase, acquisition, sale or transfer of\ncertain weapons is prohibited without the authority of the Secretary of State unless these\nactivities come within the terms of a certificate authorising such activities for the purpose of\nmaintaining, keeping or exhibiting the weapons as part of a collection. The weapons and\nammunition covered by this provision are as follows:\n(a) any firearm which is disguised as another object;\n(b) any rocket or ammunition not falling within paragraph (c) of\nsubsection (1)of this section which consists in or incorporates a missile\ndesigned to explode on or immediately before impact and is for\nmilitary use;\n(c) any launcher or other projecting apparatus not falling within paragraph\n(ae) of that subsection which is designed to be used with any rocket\nor ammunition falling within paragraph (b) above or with ammunition\nwhich would fall within that paragraph but for its being ammunition\nfalling with paragraph (c) of that subsection;\n(d) any ammunition for military use which consists in or incorporates a\nmissile designed so that a substance contained in the missile will ignite\non or immediately before impact;\n(e) any ammunition for military use which consists in or incorporates a\nmissile designed, on account of its having a jacket and hard-core, to\npenetrate armour plating, armour screening or body armour;\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n(f) any ammunition which is designed to be used with a pistol and\nincorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact;\n(g) anything which is designed to be projected as a missile from any\nweapon and is designed to be, or has been, incorporated in\n(i) any ammunition falling within any of the preceding paragraphs; or\n(ii) any ammunition which would fall within any of those paragraphs\nbut for it being specified in subsection (1) of this section.\nWeapons not subject to controls.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, some types of weapon do not require a certificate at all.\nThese include air guns, other than those of a type which have been declared by rules made\nby the Secretary of State under Section 53 of the 1968 Act to be particularly dangerous. The\nsale or hire of air weapons to those under the age of 17 is, however prohibited under the\nFirearms Act 1968. Young people under the age of 14 may not buy, hire or be given or own\nan air weapon and may use one only if they are supervised by someone who is 21 or over.\nShotguns \nSection 1(3) of the 1968 Act as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 defines a\n\"shotgun\" as follows:\n(a) a shot gun within the meaning of this Act, that is to say a smooth-\nbore gun (not being an air gun) which-\n(i) has a barrel not less than 24 inches in length and does not have\nany barrel with a bore exceeding 2 inches in diameter;\n(ii) either has no magazine or has a non-detachable magazine\nincapable of holding more than two cartridges; and\n(iii) is not a revolver gun\nUnder Section 2 of the 1968 Act it is an offence for a person to possess, purchase or acquire\nshotguns or ammunition for shotguns except within the terms of a shotgun certificate issued\nby the chief officer of police for the area in which the person resides.\nFirearms\nThese are lethal barrelled weapons of any description from which any shot, bullet or missile\ncan be discharged.\"6 other than those which come within the other three categories of weapon.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n6 Firearms Act 1968 Section 57 (i)\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nRifles, pistols, revolvers and other types of handguns are the principal weapons coming within\nthis category. Section 1 of the 1968 Act makes it an offence for a person to possess, purchase\nor acquire firearms or ammunition for firearms except within the terms of a firearm\ncertificate issued by the chief officer of police for the area in which the person resides.\n\"Handguns\"\nIn its report on the Possession of Handguns, published on July 24 1996 the Home Affairs\nCommittee noted that:7\nHandguns: a definition\n5. The word \"handgun\" is not a term used in legislation, but may be seen as a generic term\ncovering all smaller guns (generally pistols) designed to be fired from the hands rather than\nfrom the shoulder. Pistols may be:\n(i) automatic, in which case the weapon will fire continuously so long as ammunition\nis fed to it and pressure is applied to the trigger: we note that, contrary to\nwidespread belief, these weapons are already banned;\n(ii) semi-automatic, in which case separate trigger actions are required in order to fire\neach shot, but ammunition is fed to the chamber automatically from a magazine;\n(iii) revolvers, in which case ammunition is loaded into a revolving cylinder usually\ncontaining up to six rounds; or\n(iv) single-shot, in which case the pistol has to be reloaded manually for each shot.\nExemptions from the certification requirement\nThe Firearms Act 1968 provides exemptions from the need to hold a firearm or shotgun\ncertificate in some circumstances. These tend to exempt a person in particular circumstances\nin respect of firearms held, purchased or acquired for some particular and specified purpose.\nExemptions in these sorts of terms include those for:\ni) people who have obtained police permits (Section 7);\nii) authorised firearms dealers and people in business as carriers, auctioneers or\nwarehousemen for the possession of firearms or ammunition in the ordinary course of their\nbusinesses (Sections 8 and 9); \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n7 HC 393-I Session 1995-96 \n13\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\niii) people licensed to slaughter animals, for the possession of firearms in the\nslaughterhouses or knacker's yards in which they are employed, and the proprietors of such\nestablishments, or people appointed by them to take charge of slaughtering instruments, for\nthe purpose of keeping them in safe storage for the possession of firearms for that purpose\n(Section 10);\niv) firearms used in theatrical performances and film production, on board ships and aircraft,\nin certain specified circumstances (Sections 12 and 13);\nv) firearms used in sports, athletics and other approved activities, as provided by Section\n11 of the 1968 Act :\n(1) A person carrying a firearm or ammunition belonging to another\nperson holding a certificate under this Act may, without himself holding\nsuch a certificate, have in his possession that firearm or ammunition under\ninstructions from, and for the use of, that other person for sporting purposes\nonly.\n(2) A person may, without holding a certificate, have a firearm in his\npossession at an athletic meeting for the purpose of starting races at that\nmeeting.\n(3) A member of a ... cadet corps approved by the Secretary of State\nmay, without holding a certificate, have in his possession a firearm and\nammunition when engaged as a member of the ... corps in, or in connection\nwith, drill or target practice.\n(4) A person conducting or carrying on a miniature rifle range (whether\nfor a rifle club or otherwise) or shooting gallery at which no firearms are\nused other than air weapons or miniature rifles not exceeding .23 inch\ncalibre may, without holding a certificate, have in his possession, or\npurchase or acquire, such miniature rifles and ammunition suitable therefor;\nand any person may, without holding a certificate, use any such rifle and\nammunition at such a range or gallery.\n(5) A person may, without holding a shot gun certificate, borrow a shot\ngun from the occupier of private premises and use it on those premises in\nthe occupier's presence.\n(6) A person may, without holding a shot gun certificate, use a shot gun\nat a time and place approved for shooting at artificial targets by the chief\nofficer of police for the area in which that place is situated.\nSection 16 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 also provides that:\n16 Borrowed rifles on private premises\n(1) A person of or over the age of seventeen may, without holding a\nfirearm certificate, borrow a rifle from the occupier of private premises and\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nuse it on those premises in the presence either of the occupier or of a\nservant of the occupier if-\n(a) the occupier or servant in whose presence it is used holds a\nfirearm certificate in respect of that rifle; and\n(b) the borrower's possession and use of it complies with any\nconditions as to those matters specified in the certificate.\n(2) A person who by virtue of subsection (1) above is entitled without\nholding a firearm certificate to borrow and use a rifle in another person's\npresence may also, without holding such a certificate, purchase or acquire\nammunition for use in the rifle and have it in his possession during the\nperiod for which the rifle is borrowed if-\n(a) the firearm certificate held by that other person authorises the\nholder to have in his possession at that time ammunition for\nthe rifle of a quantity not less than that purchased or acquired\nby, and in the possession of, the borrower; and\n(b) the borrower's possession and use of the ammunition complies\nwith any conditions as to those matters specified in the\ncertificate.\n\"Private premises\" in these Sections of the 1968 and 1988 Acts includes land. Under Section\n7 of the Firearms Act 1968 a person may obtain a permit from the chief officer of police for\nthe area in which he resides which will enable him to possess a firearm and ammunition for\na specified purpose without holding a certificate under the 1968 Act. Section 17 of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Act 1988 also allows a visitor to Great Britain who has obtained a\nvisitors' permit from a chief officer of police in this country to possess a firearm and purchase\nor acquire ammunition, or possess a shotgun and purchase or acquire shotguns without the\nneed for a firearm or shotgun certificate.\nThe evidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to\nLord Cullen's Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane Primary School describes the uses of\nfirearms as follows:\n9. Aside from the police and military, firearms and shot guns have both occupational and\nleisure uses and there is a substantial shooting community in Great Britain. Shotguns are used\nfor game shooting, rough shooting, shooting artificial moving targets such as clay pigeons and\nby farmers and farm workers for shooting vermin.\n10. Use of rifles is generally confined to target shooting and deer stalking although one\nparticular type (.22 inch rimfire) has a long-established use in pest control on agricultural land.\nHandguns such as revolvers and pistols are generally only used for target shooting, either at\ntraditional bullseye targets or in 'practical shooting' which involves firing at multiple and\npossibly moving targets to time limits. But they too have occupational uses, for example\namong veterinary surgeons and others who may need to destroy seriously wounded animals\nquickly and humanely.\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n11. Most shooting  clubs have a firing range of their own or regular access to one, and\ncompetitive target shooting is a well established sport. It is generally organised under the\nauspices of one of the national shooting organisations, in particular the National Rifle\nAssociation, National Small-bore Rifle Association and National Pistol Association.\n12. The ranges at Bisley, Surrey, recognised by the Sports Council as the national shooting\ncentre, have occupied a prominent place in the shooting sports, both at home and abroad, for\nmany years. A number of target shooting disciplines are recognised Olympic events and\nBritish marksmen have distinguished themselves internationally over the years.\n2. Proposals to Restrict the Availability of Firearms\nFollowing the massacre at Dunblane Primary School on March 21 1996 the Government set\nup a Tribunal of Inquiry under Lord Cullen to inquire into the circumstances leading up to\nand surrounding the events at Dunblane, to consider the issues arising from those events, to\nmake interim and final recommendations and to report as soon as practicable. The report of\nThe Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 19968 was\nduly published on October 16 1996. In his report, Lord Cullen recommended that:9\n24. Consideration should be given to restricting the availability of self-\nloading pistols and revolvers of any calibre which are held by individuals for\nuse in target shooting\npreferably, by their disablement, while they are not in use, by either\n(i) the removal of the slide assembly/cylinder, which is to be kept\nsecurely on the premises of an approved club of which the owner is\na member or by a club official; or (ii) the fitting of a locked barrel\nblock by a club official (para 9.112);\nor, if such a system is not adopted, by the banning of the possession of such\nhandguns by individual owners (para 9.113).\nLord Cullen set out the rationale behind this approach in Chapter 9 of his report. He noted\nthe \"entrenched attitude\" of the shooting community's representatives at the Inquiry, who\nwere, he said, \" opposed in principle to any restriction on the availability of handguns.\"10 Lord\nCullen also referred to the role of Government and Parliament in deciding questions of policy\nin relation to the availability of handguns and other firearms:11\n9.111 At the same time l am very conscious that proposals such as a ban on\nthe possession of a certain type of firearm raise questions which are\npeculiarly within the province of the Government and Parliament to decide.\nThus after the shootings at Hungerford in August 1987. the Government\ndecided how far there should be, in \"the words of the White Paper, a shift\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Cm 3386\n9 ibid. p150\n10 ibid para 9.110\n11 ibid para 9.111\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nin the balance of controls 'between safeguarding the public at large and\nprotecting, the interests of the legitimate shooting community\" (Firearms Act\n1968: Proposals for Reform, para 4.) Michael Ryan had killed half of his\nvictims with shots from a self-loading pistol and the fact that handguns\nposed particular dangers was recognised (Green Book Part 11, para 11).\nHowever, the Government did not propose that handguns should be banned.\nThe proposal of such a ban after the shootings at Dunblane once more raises\na question of policy. It is necessary to decide what risk is acceptable,\nbearing in mind that some risk is an inevitable feature of daily life. Against\nthe risk to society has to be balanced the loss of freedom of the individual\nand the other implications which I mentioned earlier (paras 9.100-9.105).\nThere may also be competing claims on the use of resources. In the light\nof these points it is clear to me that in stating my own conclusions I should\nconfine myself to what I recommend should be considered.\nLord Cullen said that if for any reason the course he recommended was not followed he saw\nno alternative to considering the \"more draconian alternative\" of a ban on multi-shot\nhandguns. He added that:12\nHowever. in such circumstances I would suggest that the ban should be\ndirected to the possession of such handguns by individual owners rather than\nthe possession of handguns by shooting clubs, since it is through possession\nby individuals that the risk, in so far as there is a risk, of homicide or\nserious injury arises. Thus I do not consider that the banning of handguns\nfor target shooting or the banning of shooting clubs would be justified. I\nhave no particular recommendation as to the legislative means by which\neffect would be given to such a ban.\nLord Cullen set out the arguments which had been presented to him concerning a total ban\non guns and his view of those arguments as follows:13\n7.12 At this point I turn to consider the submission made by Mr C M\nCampbell QC who represented the families of the deceased children, the\ninjured children, the children who were absent from class and Mrs Harrild\nand Mrs Blake. I take this submission first since it would have as its logical\nconsequence the ending of the certification system for any category of\nfirearm. It follows therefore that I should deal with it before going further\ninto the questions which I have posed in the last two paragraphs.\n7.13 Mr Campbell emphasised at the outset that Thomas Hamilton's actions\nhad thrown into relief the dangers to society of there being many people\narmed with \"weapons designed to kill\" and able to accomplish this with\nrapid and clinical efficiency. The time had come for radical change. There\nshould be \"a complete ban on the civilian ownership, possession and use of\nall types of gun\". In support of that submission he put forward the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 ibid para 9.113 \n13 Cm 3386 p.81-83\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nfollowing. First, even with the most thorough safeguards, the potential for\nanother Dunblane would remain. Mistakes would occur. Second, there was\nalways a conflict or tension between limited resources on the one hand and\nthe need for a rigorous system of control on the other. Third, there was a\ntension between a police force seeking to regulate the shooting community\nand a police force which was under pressure to provide a good service to the\nsame people. It could not be ensured that public safety would always be the\nparamount consideration. Fourth, there was always a potential for an\nindividual's circumstances to change in such a way that danger arose where\nnone existed before. The current firearms laws were not designed to cope\nwith the present relatively large number of urban residents who possessed\nsemiautomatic handguns for no reason other than target shooting. Fifth, the\ncurrent system and the existence of shooting clubs would continue to\nintroduce many thousands of people to guns over the years people who\notherwise would not be familiar with them. Not all of them were of\nimpeccable character. Some were attracted by the guns themselves, their\nsupposed glamour and their boost to the ego. Sixth, there was, he said, an\napparently well-established link between access to guns and the rate of gun-\ncrimes and gun-suicides.\n7.14 Mr Campbell added that the debate should not be influenced by any\nsupposed inherent right to hold guns. A safety-first philosophy should be\nadopted and this pointed to radical change. Any decision to continue to\npermit lawful possession of firearms necessarily implied a willingness to\ntolerate an increased rate of gun-crime and gun-suicide. It might be thought\nthat the shooting community \"do themselves few favours by their apparent\nreluctance to countenance any material change\".\n7.15 The BSSC in their final written submission pointed out that no\nwitness at the Inquiry. with the exception of Mr McMurdo, the former\nDeputy Chief Constable of Central Scotland Police, suggested such a\nprohibition. They pointed out that the Dunblane Snowdrop Petition stopped\nshort of such a call. in submitting that all firearms held for recreational\npurposes for use in authorised sporting clubs should be held securely at such\nclubs with the firm, mechanisms removed. and that the private ownership of\nhandguns be made illegal. The BSSC maintained that there was no\nconvincing evidence that if Thomas Hamilton had been denied lawful access\nto firearms. he would not have found and used some other means to carry\nout his premeditated plans, or been able in a relatively short space of time\nto acquire a firearm and ammunition from the \"vast stock of illegally-held\nguns in circulation\". They drew attention to the statement in the Green\nBook (Part II. paras 4 and 6) that such a prohibition would be unprecedented\nin a democratic country and would have very serious consequences.\nincluding adverse economic impact. Mr Mark Scoggins, who appeared for\nthe BSSC during closing submissions. observed that even if a tension existed\nbetween a duty to regulate and a pressure to provide a service it was not in\nany way unique to target shooting. He instanced to position of other\nregulators such as the Health and Safety Executive. The general function\nof the police was to provide a service to the community. Even if there was\na potential conflict or tension, the solution was to combine firmness with\nfairness. It was not correct to depict firearms laws as out of joint with the\nscale of firearm-ownership in modern times. Evidence had been given as\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nto the large number of guns in private ownership before the first legislation\nin 1920. The assertion that the shooting community had done itself few\nfavours overlooked the fact that their position was that \"at the centre is the\nindividual not guns\". In that respect they had made a number of proposals.\nSound reasons had been given for not adopting various means of control\nover guns which had been suggested. Mr C N McEachran QC who\nappeared for the Scottish Target Shooting Federation drew my attention to\nsubmissions which had challenged the assertion that there was a link\nbetween the availability of guns and the rate of gun-crime.\n7.16 The submission made by Mr Campbell is of such width that it would\nembrace not merely handguns. with which the Inquiry was directly\nconcerned. but also rifles, shot guns and air weapons: and would admit of\nno exceptions. It would prevent the use of guns for occupational purposes\nsuch as shot guns used for shooting game and vermin, rifles for deer\nstocking and pest control: and handguns for humane disposal of seriously\ninjured animals, slaughtering of animals and signalling the start of races at\nathletic meetings. No doubt it would be possible to devise a system of\nexceptions which could be grafted on to a wholesale prohibition.\nHowever, the more fundamental point is that the range of uses for these\ntypes of guns is very different. Thus the considerations relating to the\npossession and use of shotguns are concerned with very different areas of\nactivity from those relating to handguns. I am not persuaded that it is\njustifiable to approach all these types in essentially the same manner. That\nis quite apart from the fact that I do not consider that the availability of shot\nguns is a matter which has a tenable connection with the circumstances with\nwhich this Inquiry is concerned.\n7.17 For these reasons I do not recommend that such a wholesale prohibition\nshould be considered. However, that is not to say that I will not have to\nlook at the case for restricting, the availability of certain firearms with which\nthe Inquiry is concerned. In doing so I will have to take account of\narguments which I have summarised above, as well as many more besides.\nHe also made the following remarks about the banning of the possession by individuals of\nmulti-shot handguns:14\n9.95 This is the course of action which is advocated by ACOPS in the\nform of a recommendation that \"all multi-shot pistols be raised to the\nprohibited category\" , ie so that they would fall within section 5 of the 1968\nAct. However, as Chief Constable Cameron explained in evidence, ACOPS\nenvisaged that the Secretary of State would authorise such handguns to be\npossessed by shooting clubs where they would be stored. Both ACOPS and\nACPO recommend that the handguns in respect of which firearm certificates\nmay be granted for target shooting should be restricted to a single shot and\nto .22 calibre. The Police Federation of England and Wales advocate that\nthe private possession of all handguns should be banned. It may be noted\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Cm 3386 p.126-127\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthat the position of ACPO has changed since the hearing before the Home\nAffairs Committee on 8 May. At that time their position was that a\nprohibition on the licensed possession of handguns was impracticable.\nGiven ACPO's views to the Committee Mr Sharples acknowledged that\nGreat Britain featured in national/international, European and Olympic\nevents and that the use of handguns in connection with that sporting interest\nwas extensive. A complete ban of handguns would cause significant\ndifficulties for a very substantial law-abiding element in the country who\npursued quite proper sporting activities (Q19).\n9.96 The practicability of such a measure was not questioned save in one\nrespect. It was suggested that the EC Weapons Directive (91/447/EEC)\nwould prevent the implementation of such a ban. This Directive provided\nfor the partial harmonisation of Member States' domestic firearms controls\nin order to reach consistency in regard to minimum standards. However, it\nallows Member States to maintain or introduce domestic controls which are\nmore stringent than those standards. provided that the European Commission\nand other Member States are advised accordingly. Thus, as I understand the\nposition, the Directive does not prevent this country from introducing such\na ban. The Directive is due to be reviewed by the European Commission\nby the end of 1997. This will provide an opportunity for the Government\nto put its case for altering any of the prohibitions which apply to all Member\nStates if it sees a case for so doing.\n9.97 As I have already indicated in the first part of the chapter it was\nquestioned whether any restriction on the legal availability of firearms would\nbe effective. It was suggested that the owners of handguns which were\ncurrently in lawful possession might avoid confiscation by causing them to\n\"disappear\". Examples of this phenomenon were drawn by some\ncommentators from the past history of firearms control in this country and\nin Germany. Even if the withdrawal of lawfully held handguns was\nachieved, professional criminals and others who were bent on mischief could\nobtain illegal handguns. Further there was a risk that by process of\n\"displacement\" they might resort to the use of other types of firearm, such\nas shot guns, which were capable of delivering shots which were more\ndevastating, or to other methods of destruction such as bombs. There was\nnothing to suggest that the banning of self-loading rifles under the 1988 Act\n(which had led to the confiscation of Thomas Hamilton's rifle) had prevented\nthe happening of anything that was worse than occurred. The same points\nalso apply to the proposal that the handguns in respect of which firearm\ncertificates may be granted for target shooting should be restricted to .22\ncalibre.\n9.98 None of these points can be dismissed from consideration. However\ngiven that lawfully held handguns are identified in firearm certificates, the\nopportunity for them to \"disappear\" is much less than if they were not\nidentified at all. I have already rejected the contention that legally held\nfirearms are of no significance in regard to the commission of crime, and\nexpressed the view that the arguments in support of weapon substitution are\noverstated. I am not convinced that a restriction on the availability of\nhandguns would actually lead to an increase in injury. I am satisfied that\na ban on the possession of multi-shot handguns would have some effect on\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthe incidence of serious crime.\nIn its response to Lord Cullen's Report the Government said it intended to go further than\nLord Cullen had suggested and prohibit all higher calibre handguns. It also proposed to\nprohibit people from keeping even single shot handguns at home:15\nAs recommended by Lord Cullen the Government has considered restricting\nthe availability of self-loading hand guns. It has given careful consideration\nto Lord Cullen's suggestions, which fall into two parts. It has concluded that\nneither would provide an acceptable level of public safety. \nFirst of all he has suggested two methods by which hand guns might be\ndisabled. The first involves the removal of key components from the gun.\nWhile removal of key components is feasible for certain types of guns, it is\nnot a practical proposition for others. Alternatively, Lord Cullen has\nindicated that weapons might be disabled by fitting a locked \"barrel block\"\nto the gun. He recognised however that such devices are currently\nmanufactured only for shot guns. Even if they were available, the Forensic\nScience Service-which advises the Government on the technical aspects of\nfirearms including their deactivation-is not convinced that a barrel block or\nsimilar device could not be removed by a determined individual and the\nGovernment does not, therefore, believe that it could rely on such a measure.\nLord Cullen's second suggestion is that if guns cannot be disabled,\nconsideration should be given to banning the possession of self-loading\npistols and revolvers by individuals. In the light of this the Government has\ndecided to legislate early in the next session of Parliament to ban all hand\nguns of more than .22 calibre including those used by Thomas Hamilton.\nThis will mean that at least 160,000 guns-80% of those legally held at\npresent-will be destroyed. All hand guns chambered for .22 rimfire\nammunition, including single shot guns, will also be banned unless they are\nkept in licensed gun clubs under conditions of the most stringent security.\nThis means that, in two important respects, the Government intends to go\nfurther than Lord Cullen's proposals: by banning all higher calibre handguns;\nand by prohibiting people from keeping even single shot handguns at home.\nIn his statement to the House on the day the Cullen report and the Government's response to\nit were published the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, set out the Government's legislative\nintentions in relation to handguns as follows:16\nI come to the question that I know will be of\ngreatest concern to the House and the nation: the\ncontrols on the ownership of handguns. Lord\nCullen confines his suggestions to self-loading\npistols and revolvers of all calibres. He does not\nconsider that further restrictions are required for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n15 The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 - The Government Response.\nCm 3392 p5\n16 HC Deb Vol 282 c832-833 16.10.1996\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nsingle-shot handguns, which he would allow to be\nkept in the home, as at present. He suggests that\nowners of multi-shot guns should be required to\ndisable them when keeping them at home, and goes\non to say that, if after consideration those\narrangements are found not to be practicable, there\nshould instead be a ban on the possession of multi-\nshot handguns by individual owners. He envisages\nthat it would still be possible for guns to be kept by\na club secretary so that target shooting could\ncontinue, using guns owned by the club.\nThe Government have taken advice from the\nForensic Science Service on the practicability of\nLord Cullen's suggestions for disabling handguns.\nLord Cullen himself recognised that there were\nconsiderable practical difficulties in removing key\ncomponents from handguns. The Forensic Science\nService has confirmed that view. It is also not\nconvinced that a barrel block-Lord Cullen's other\nsuggestion-could be made that someone with\nsufficient determination and access to metal-\nworking tools could not remove. As a result, I\nhave come to the conclusion that we cannot\nrecommend that approach to the House.\nI therefore come to Lord Cullen's alternative\nsuggestion of banning multi-shot handguns from\nindividual ownership. I propose to go considerably\nfurther than Lord Cullen has suggested in two\nrespects. First, we shall ban all handguns from\npeople's homes. I do not agree with Lord Cullen\nthat it would be safe to allow single-shot handguns\nto remain in the home. I believe that they should\nbe subject to the same controls as those imposed on\nmulti-shot handguns.\nSecondly, we shall outlaw high-calibre\nhandguns of the kind used by Thomas Hamilton.\nLow-calibre handguns-.22 rimfire handguns-will\nhave to be used and kept in licensed clubs. We\nbelieve that a distinction needs to be made between\nhigh-calibre handguns, which are principally made\nfor police and military use, and .22 rimfire\nhandguns, which are largely intended for target\nshooting. Although Lord Cullen decided against\nmaking such a distinction, he sets out in paragraph\n9.49 of his report a table that demonstrates that a\n.22 handgun is some four to six times less powerful\nthan higher-calibre handguns.\nIn paragraph 9.44, Lord Cullen points out that\nthe expansion in the use of high-calibre handguns\nhas even made many shooters concerned about the\nuse of such guns symbols of personal power. In\naddition, target shooting with .22 handguns has\nbeen an Olympic sport since 1896. There will be\nexceptions for the very few professionals, such as\nvets, who need handguns outside gun clubs for the\nhumane destruction of animals.\nThe proposals will mean that at least 160,000\nhandguns-80 per cent. of those legally held at.\npresent will be destroyed. Appropriate\ncompensation will be paid.\nIn setting out the Labour Party's response to these proposals Jack Straw said that:17\nAs we heard from the Secretary of State for\nScotland, Thomas Hamilton -one man-killed 16\nchildren and one teacher, and injured 17 others, by\ndischarging 105 rounds of ammunition from a\nsingle semi-automatic handgun in the space of three\nminutes. Handguns are small, portable, easy to\nhide and lethal. In the light of Lord Cullen's\nreport-and especially his analysis-it is our\nconsidered judgment that handguns should be\nbanned altogether from general civilian use.\nMay I make it clear to the Secretary of State\nthat we shall of course co-operate fully to ensure\nthat legislation is passed speedily through\nParliament, to implement the will of this House and\nthe other place for a root-and-branch reform of gun\nlaw? We welcome almost everything in the\nSecretary of State's statement, and especially the\ncomplete ban on all handguns from people's homes.\nBut, with respect, we do not believe that his\nproposals go far enough. Let me briefly give our\nreasons.\nIn the evidence submitted to the Cullen inquiry\non behalf of the Labour party by my hon. Friend\nthe Member for Hamilton and me, we said that\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n17 HC Deb Vol 282 c834-835 16.10.1996\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthere was a strong case for banning all handguns,\napart from some very limited occupational\nexceptions such as vets and casualty slaughterers.\nWe then said that it was for the shooting fraternity\nto make a case for exceptions to that-for example,\nin respect of single-shot .22 pistols. But, in our\njudgment, the shooting fraternity has failed to do\nso.\nLord Cullen says that an exemption for single-\nshot .22 handguns would be both impractical and\nineffective because they could easily be reconverted\nto multi-shot guns, and we accept that view. Partial\nbans, moreover, would create extra work for the\npolice. As the Police Federation said in its\nevidence to Lord Cullen, .22 weapons may be just\nas lethal as higher-calibre weapons.\nIn reply to this the Home Secretary made the following comments about proposals for a\ncomplete prohibition on the ownership and possession of handguns:18\nMr. Howard: I am grateful to the hon.\nGentleman for the remarks with which he began his\nobservations. He identified with some precision the\ndifference that lies between us. We believe that it\nis possible to give the public the protection that\nthey rightly require and deserve without going so\nfar as to put in place a complete prohibition on the\nownership and possession of handguns for which\nthe hon. Gentleman called. We believe that if it is\npossible to provide that protection without a\ncomplete ban, it is the Government's duty to take\nthat course.\nI ask the hon. Gentleman and those sitting\nbehind him to reflect on the unhappy history of the\ncomplete prohibition of activities hitherto regarded\nas lawful. It would not be in anyone's interests,\nleast of all the protection of the public, to drive\nunderground an activity that could then be\nconducted without any safeguards for security,\nwhereas if it remains possible to carry out that\nactivity legitimately, under extremely secure\nsafeguards, the public's protection might be greater.\nI ask him to reflect on that.\nSpeaking for the Liberal Democrats Alan Beith said:19\nMr. A. J. Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed): Does\nthe Home Secretary accept the following\nproposition, the importance of which was\nunderlined by the slaughter at Dunblane? In this\ncountry, we regard the possession of guns not as a\nright, but as a privilege that has to be carefully\ncontrolled and safeguarded to protect public safety\nand public confidence. As the Government's\nproposals have much common ground with our\nproposals to the Cullen inquiry, will the Home\nSecretary note that we are prepared to support and\nfacilitate legislation based on those proposals, as\nlong as the House has an opportunity to consider\non a free vote whether a ban on 80 per cent. of\nhandguns is adequate and workable or whether it is\nnecessary to go further?\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18 HC Deb Vol 282 c835-836 16.10.1996\n19 HC Deb Vol 282 c836-837 \n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nUnder the Government's proposals, who would be\nallowed to transport guns between one gun club\nand another or from a gun club to a competition?\nDoes the Home Secretary agree that it would be\nwrong to pretend that either the proposals or a total\nban provided any guarantee against the misuse of\nguns leading to a slaughter such as that at\nDunblane, so vigilance and effective and well-\nresourced policing remain essential?\nThe Home Secretary replied that:20\nMr. Howard: I agree with the right hon.\nGentleman's first proposition, that there is no right\nto hold a gun under our laws and that it is a\nprivilege. I agree with that approach and I note\nwhat he said about his party's approach to the\nlegislation.\nOn the transportation of guns from one club to\nanother under the proposed arrangements, we intend\nto have consultations with chief constables and\nothers about the details but, as I said in my\nstatement, we envisage that it should be permitted\nonly in the most limited circumstances and under\nthe most stringent controls. For example, the\ntransportation should be effected not by the owner\nof the gun, but by a third party specifically\nauthorised for that purpose.\nI entirely agree with what the right hon.\nGentleman said about illegally held weapons and\nabout the need for continued vigilance to deal with\nthat very considerable problem.\nSome commentators have criticised the Government for not proposing a complete prohibition\non handguns, citing the view of the Police Federation, in its evidence to Lord Cullen, that .22\ncalibre firearms may be as lethal as higher-calibre weapons. Press reports claimed that\nweapons of this calibre had been used in the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Yitzhak\nRabin, and in the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr. Some\ncommentators have also called for a general prohibition on shotguns, noting, as Lord Cullen\ndid,21 that an individual shot from a handgun, depending on the distance and calibre, may be\nless lethal than a shot from a shotgun or rifle. In its report on The Possession of Handguns\nthe Home Affairs Committee noted that:22\n6. The Home Office, in evidence to Lord Cullen's inquiry which was prepared jointly with\nthe Scottish Office, and which was also submitted to this inquiry, maintained that handguns,\nbeing small, easily concealed and carried, and capable of rapidly firing a large number of\nrounds without reloading, were weapons of a \"particularly dangerous nature\". This view is\nnot universally held;' it may be argued that a shot from a standard rifle will generate more\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 HC Deb Vol 282 c837 16.10.1996\n21 Cm 3386 para 9.59\n22 HC 393-I Session 1995-96\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nenergy than will a shot from a typical self-loading handgun; a shotgun is likely to have a\ngreater destructive capacity even at close range, due to the spread of the shot.\nLord Cullen also referred in his report to the dangers posed by the use of air weapons at large\nand whether they should be subject to certification and unavailable until a later age than at\npresent. During the debate which followed the Home Secretary's statement on the Cullen\nreport the Home Secretary made the following remarks in reply to questions from Chris\nMullin about the dangers posed by shotguns and air weapons:23\nMr. Chris Mullin (Sunderland, South): I thank\nthe Home Secretary for endorsing the main plank\nof the minority report from the Home Affairs\nCommittee on the issue. It is not every day that a\nminority report is endorsed so swiftly by the Home\nOffice. I have one or two others that he might like\nto reconsider.\nDid the Home Secretary hear the comments this\nmorning by Mr. Michael Yardley, a firearms expert,\nthat it was pointless to ban handguns if something\nwas not also done about shotguns? Is it not about\ntime that we made a start on collecting some of the\n2 million shotguns in circulation, starting in urban\nareas? Everyone acknowledges that farmers need\nshotguns, for reasons that we all know about, but it\nis hard to understand why licences should be\ngranted to shotgun owners in urban areas.\nDoes the Home Secretary have any plans to do\nanything about the misuse of air weapons, which,\nas many of our colleagues will know, are\nresponsible for a great deal of mayhem in urban\nareas?\nMr. Howard: I note the hon. Gentleman's\nopening remarks. I am sure that he does not expect\nme to give any undertaking on my reaction to\nminority reports from the Home Affairs Committee\nin future. I do not follow the hon. Gentleman in\nhis observations about shotguns. Shotguns have\nmany wider applications than do handguns, which\nare restricted to target shooting. I do not think that\nthe hon. Gentleman has made a case for the\nrestriction on shotguns to which he has referred.\nSimilar observations apply to air rifles.\nThe Home Affairs Committee's report on The Possession of Handguns,24 the report of Lord\nCullen's Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane25and the evidence submitted to Lord Cullen's\nInquiry on behalf of the Secretary for Scotland and the Home Secretary all contain views on\nthe possible effects of total or partial prohibitions of various types of guns or of all guns.\nConservative members of the Home Affairs Committee voted against recommendations that\nthe possession of handguns be banned and a number of other proposals concerning shotguns\nand airguns. The Committee's report, which caused much controversy, went on reach the\nfollowing conclusions on the subject of banning various categories of firearm:26\nBanning the possession of all guns\n5. We conclude that a ban on the possession of all guns would be too far-reaching.\n(para 50)\n6. We believe that a ban upon all guns would not prevent unstable individuals from\ngaining access to guns illegally, and we therefore reject this option. (para 51)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n23 HC Deb Vol 282 c837-838 16.10.1996\n24 HC 393-I Session 1995-96 p.xvi-xxiv\n25 Cm 3386 paras 7.12-7.17 & 9.63-9.113\n26 HC 393-I Session 1995-96 pxxxiv\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n7. We believe that the opportunity should also be taken to review the restrictions\nupon possession of guns by young people, with regard to public safety. (para 52)\nBanning the possession of handguns\n8. We see no point in a total ban on the possession of handguns alone, and we do not\nrecommend it. (para 59)\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nPartial bans on the possession of handguns\n9. We doubt that a ban upon either the possession of handguns of above a certain\ncalibre, or on the possession of multi-shot handguns, would make a mass killing\nany less likely. We therefore reject these options. (para 63)\n10. Although we see some value in the proposal that handguns should be centrally\nstored, we do not believe that a determined criminal would be prevented from\nusing a weapon for criminal purposes; we therefore reject this suggestion. (para 69)\n11. We do not favour the proposal for possession of assembled handguns to be banned\nother than at licensed premises. (para 70)\n12. Although we see [a ban on possession of a handgun with ammunition] as a\npotentially attractive solution, we have concluded that there are significant\npractical difficulties which cannot be easily overcome, and we therefore reject it.\n(para 72)\n13. We reject the proposal for restrictions to be placed upon the number of handguns\nthat an individual might hold. (para 73)\nIn its report the Home Affairs Committee said it believed that the problems posed by illegally\nheld firearms were on a far larger scale than those posed by legally held firearms.27 It also\nnoted that policy on firearms control appeared to be formed without the benefit of statistical\nmaterial on the proportion of crime committed with stolen or borrowed legally-held weapons\nand recommended that records be kept of the sources of firearms recovered after crime.28 Lord\nCullen noted that while the statistical evidence available to him and to which he had referred\nwas of limited value it did show that while illegal firearms were used in the great majority\nof firearm-related crimes, and especially robberies, the existence of legally held firearms led\nto their use in crime in a significant, though relatively small number of cases. (Chapter 9 of\nLord Cullen's report and paragraphs 33-36 of the Home Affairs Committee's report discuss\nthe evidence and arguments on this subject in some detail.)

New Restrictions on Firearms - Part I of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill\n \nClause 1 of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill is intended to prohibit all handguns other than\nsmall-calibre pistols and signalling apparatus by adding the following firearms to the list of\nprohibited weapons set out in Section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968:\n\"(aba) any firearm which either has a barrel less than 30 centimetres in\nlength or is less than 60 centimetres in length overall, other than an air\nweapon to which section I of this Act does not apply, a small-calibre\npistol or a firearm designed as signalling apparatus;\".\nThe possession, purchase, acquisition, manufacture, sale or transfer of these weapons without\nthe authority of the Secretary of State will be an offence punishable on summary conviction\nby up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine and on indictment by up to ten years'\nimprisonment30 and a fine.\nClauses 2,3,4 and 5 of the Bill are intended to provide exemptions from the need for\nauthorisation from the Secretary of State in respect of a handgun prohibited by virtue of\nClause 1 in four sets of circumstances. These are:\ni) Slaughtering Instruments, where the person possessing, purchasing, acquiring, selling\nor transferring the instrument is authorised by a firearm certificate to have in his possession,\npurchase or acquire such an instrument, or where he has it in his possession and is entitled\nto do so without a firearm certificate under Section 10 of the Firearms Act 1968. (Section 10\nof the 1968 Act permits licensed animal slaughterers and others to have slaughtering\ninstruments in their possession in certain circumstances - see p.12 above)\nii) Firearms used for the humane killing of animals, where the person is authorised under\na firearm certificate to have in his possession, purchase, acquire, sell or transfer a firearm\nsubject to a condition that it is only for use in connection with the humane killing of animals;\niii) Firearms used in connection with starting races at athletic meetings, where a person is\nauthorised under a firearm certificate to have in his possession, purchase or acquire a firearm\nsubject to a condition that it is only for use in connection with starting races at athletic\nmeetings, or where the person has it in his possession for that purpose at an athletic meeting.\niv) Trophies of war, where a person has in his possession a firearm which is a trophy of\nwar acquired by him before 1 January 1946 and has a firearm certificate authorising him to\ndo so. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n30 Firearms Act 1968 Schedule 6 as amended by Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Schedule 8\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nSection 19 of the Firearms Act 1968 Act makes it an offence for a person to have a loaded\nshotgun or air weapon, or any other loaded or unloaded firearm, together with ammunition\nsuitable for use in that firearm, with him in a public place, without lawful authority or\nreasonable excuse (the proof of which lies on him, rather than the prosecution). Halsbury's\nStatutes notes that \"with him in a public place\" is thought to mean \"knowingly has with him\nin any public place\"31\nClause 6 will insert a new Section 19A in the Firearms Act 1968, designed to make it an\noffence for \"any person to have a small-calibre pistol [that is, a pistol chambered for .22 or\nsmaller rim-fire cartridges]32 with him outside licensed premises of a licensed pistol club\".\nOn the basis of the case-law referred to in Halsbury's Statutes it would seem likely that \"with\nhim\" here will be taken to mean \"knowingly with him\" The offence will be punishable on\nsummary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine, and on conviction\non indictment by up to ten years' imprisonment and a fine. It will not be an offence for a\nperson to have such a weapon with him if he is permitted under the Act to have the pistol\nin his possession without holding a firearm certificate, if he is authorised to have the pistol\nin his possession under a firearm certificate which is not subject to a condition requiring it\nto be kept at a licensed pistol club, or if he is authorised to do so by virtue of a police permit\nunder Clause 8 of the Bill.\nClause 7 of the Bill is intended to ensure that, where a person applies for a firearm certificate\nfor a small-calibre pistol and the chief officer of police is satisfied that the applicant's only\nreason for having the pistol in his possession is to use it for target shooting, any certificate\ngranted to the applicant should be held subject to at least the following conditions:\na) the pistol is only to be used for target shooting;\nb) the holder must be a member of a licensed pistol club specified in the certificate;\nc) the pistol must be kept and used only at specified licensed premises of that club.\nAn existing firearm certificate relating to a small-calibre pistol, which is subject to the\ncondition that the pistol is only to be used on an approved range, will, after the\nimplementation of the provisions in the Bill, be treated as being held subject to the new\nconditions set out in Clause 7.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 Halsbury's Statutes Fourth Edition Volume 12 p450 citing R v Cugullere [1961] 2 All ER 343\n32 defined in an amendment to Section 57 of the 1968 Act which is to be inserted by Clause 1(6) of the Bill\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nA person who fails to comply with these conditions and thereby commits an offence under\nSection 1(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 is to be treated, for the purposes of sentencing, as\nhaving committed that offence in an aggravated form. At present this offence is a summary\noffence punishable by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine. Under amendments\nset out in paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Bill the aggravated form will also be punishable\nfollowing conviction on indictment by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine. \nClause 8 is intended to enable chief officers of police to issue permits authorising small-\ncalibre pistols to be taken outside licensed club premises for any \"proper purpose\" Clause 8(3)\ngoes on to say that:\n(3) A proper purpose for having a small-calibre pistol outside the licensed\npremises of a licensed pistol club may be any of the following, namely-\n(a) having the pistol repaired or maintained by a registered firearms\ndealer;\n(b) conveying the pistol from a police station at which it has been\nkept to a licensed pistol club or from one such club to another;\n(c) enabling the pistol to be used at a recognised target shooting\ncompetition;\n(d) selling or otherwise disposing of the pistol; or\n(e) any other purpose which appears to the chief officer of police to\nbe proper in all the circumstances.\nChief officers will be able to attach conditions to these permits in the interest of safety. It will\nbe an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a\n£5,000 fine for a person to fail to comply with such a condition or \"knowingly or recklessly\"\nto make a false statement for the purpose of procuring a permit for himself or another under\nthis provision.\nClause 9 and Schedule 1 of the Bill set out transitional arrangements intended to enable\nholders of small-calibre pistols to hand them to the police until such time as they can become\nmembers of licensed pistol clubs. They will be required to become members of such clubs\nwithin a transitional period of a year from the implementation of the relevant provisions of\nthe Bill, or a longer period, if this is specified in an order made by the Secretary of State\nusing the negative procedure. Small-calibre pistols handed in under these provisions will be\nretrievable provided that the police are given written notice at least four weeks before the end\nof the transitional period. If they are not retrieved within the transitional period they will be\ntreated as having been surrendered to the police. It will be an offence punishable on summary\nconviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine for a person knowingly or\nrecklessly to make a false statement for the purpose of procuring the release of a pistol from\npolice custody, whether it is for himself or for another person.\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nC. Firearm and Shotgun Certification Procedures\n1. Current Arrangements\nThe procedure governing the grant, renewal, variation and revocation of firearm and shotgun\ncertificates is set out in Sections 26-32 of the Firearms Act 1968. A Home Office publication\nFirearms Law: Guidance to the Police, which was published in 1989, explains the provisions\nof the 1968 Act as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and others and gives\nguidance to the police on how they should exercise their discretion in respect of the grant,\nvariation and revocation of firearm and shotgun certificates and other matters.\nThe current certification procedures are summarised in the evidence submitted on behalf of\nthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to Lord Cullen's Inquiry as\nfollows:33\n27. The two main levels of control are the shot gun certificate and firearm certificate\n(sections 1 and 2 of the 19 68 Act) . Like a firearm certificate, a shot gun certificate is issued\nby the chief officer of police. But the licensing regime it imposes is different from, and less\nstringent than, that imposed by the firearm certificate.\n28. Firearm and shot gun certificates both bear four standard, statutory conditions - These\nrequire the holder to sign the certificate, to inform the police of thefts and losses and of any\nchange of address, and to keep the weapons and ammunition securely. There are three major\nadditional restrictions in the licensing regime imposed by the firearm, as compared with the\nshot gun, certificate. These are\na to obtain a firearm certificate, the applicant has to show the police that he has a good\nreason for possessing all the firearms and ammunition which it covers;\nb  every firearm and piece of ammunition covered by a firearm certificate must be\napproved by the police in advance; and\nc the police may place additional  conditions upon firearm certificates, such as, for\nexample, that the firearm is to be used only at a particular shooting range.\n29. The first two of these differences derive from the fact that the applicant for a firearm\ncertificate has to demonstrate that he has a good reason for possessing 'the firearm or\nammunition in respect of which (the application) is made,' (section 27(1) of the 1968 Act).\nBut the applicant for a shot gun certificate does not (though the police cannot - section 28\n(1A) (b) of the 1968 Act - grant a shot gun certificate if they are satisfied that the applicant\ndoes not have a good reason for possessing a shot gun).\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n33 Dep p7-8\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n30. Similarly, the holder of a shot gun certificate does not have to seek police permission\nbefore obtaining a new shot gun. He must however keep his shot gun certificate up to date\nto list all the guns which it covers (section 28(2A) of the 1968 Act), and both he and the\ndealer, or other person, who sells him a gun is required to notify the police of the sale (see\nthe notes on the rear of the shot gun certificate in the Firearms Rules (Scotland) 1989 and\nsection 4 of the 1988 Act).\n31. The police may add further conditions to a firearm certificate under the terms of\nsection 27 (2) of the 1968 Act. The Act places no limitations on the conditions which the\npolice may impose on a firearm certificate. These vary widely to suit the circumstances, and\nthere is extensive Home Office advice about them in Chapter 6 of the published Home Office\nGuidance to the Police (see Annex C).\n32. However the police may not, in general, add further conditions to a shot gun certificate.\nThe only (minor) exception to that is when the certificate authorises the holder to possess a\nshot gun disguised as another object (for example a walking stick gun) as part of a collection.\n33. The police are then required to add a fifth condition to the shot gun certificate. The\nwording of this is specified by law (Rule 4A of the Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1989, as\ninserted by Rule 4 of the Firearms (Scotland) (Amendment) Rules 1992 - it reads a shot gun\nwhich is disguised as another object is possessed, purchased or acquired by the holder of the\ncertificate only for the purpose of its being kept or exhibited as part of a collection I) . There\nare no circumstances in which the law allows chief officers to formulate additional conditions\nfor a shot gun certificate, as they can with a firearm certificate.\n34. Firearm and shot gun certificates must be renewed at regular intervals. There is scope\nfor firearm certificates to be varied, and there is provision for applicants who disagree with\npolice decisions in respect of them to appeal against these decisions in the Courts.\n \nFirearm Certificates\nSections 27(1) and 27(1A) of the Firearms Act 1968 provide that:\n(1) A firearm certificate shall be granted by the chief officer of police\nif he is satisfied that the applicant has a good reason tor having in his\npossession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or ammunition in\nrespect of which the application is made, and can be permitted to have it in\nhis possession without danger to the public safety or to the peace:\nProvided that a firearm certificate shall not be granted to a person whom\nthe chief officer of police has reason to believe to be prohibited by this Act\nfrom possessing a firearm to which section 1 of this Act applies, or to be of\nintemperate habits or unsound mind, or to be for any reason unfitted to be\nentrusted with such a firearm.\n[(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1) above a person under the age\nof eighteen shall be capable of having good reason for having a firearm or\nammunition in his possession, or for purchasing or acquiring it, only if he\nhas no intention of using the firearm or ammunition, at any time before he\nattains the age of eighteen, for a purpose not authorised by the European\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nweapons directive.]\nIn commenting on the grant or refusal of firearm certificates the Home Office guidance notes\nthat :34\n6.6 The most important duty imposed by the Act on the police is that of deciding whether\nor not a firearm certificate should be granted. The criteria which chief officers of police\nshould apply in exercising their discretion are set out in section 27(1). A chief officer of\npolice must not grant a certificate to any person whom he has reason to believe to be:\n(a) prohibited by the Act from possessing a firearm, eg a person to whom section 21\napplies; or\n(b) of intemperate habits or unsound mind; or\n(c) to be for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm.\n6.7 If the grant of the certificate is not so precluded, the chief officer of police has to\nsatisfy himself on two points: that the applicant\n(a) has a good reason for requiring the firearm or ammunition in respect of which the\napplication is made; and\n(b) can be permitted to have the firearm or ammunition without danger to public safety\nor to the peace.\nForces will normally be expected to give reasons for their decision to refuse an application for\na firearm certificate.\nThe guidance sets out a number of points for police officers to bear in mind when considering\napplications for firearm certificates. These include the following 35\n(a) The reason given for desiring a firearm must be one applicable to the particular class\nof firearm which the person desires to possess. It should be recognised that some\nclasses of firearm do have more than one legitimate use.\n(b) The terms of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 make it an offence to kill certain\ntypes of wildlife, and also restrict the type of firearm that can be used in those limited\ncircumstances where killing is permitted. Advice on this Act can be obtained from the\nDepartment of the Environment, Wildlife Division, Tollgate House, Houlton Street,\nBristol BS2 9DJ for use in England and Wales, and from the Department of Agriculture\nand Fisheries for Scotland, Chesser House, Gorgie Road, Edinburgh, for use in\nScotland.\n(c) Similarly, the Deer Act 1963 as amended by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (in\nScotland the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959 and the Deer (Close Seasons) (Scotland) order\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n34 Firearms Law: Guidance to the Police - Home Office (1989) p67-8\n35 ibid p.68-71\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n1984) prohibit the taking of deer at certain times and make it an offence to use certain\ndevices, including some types of firearm and calibres, against then. Schedule 2 to the\nDeer Act 1963 prohibits the use of rifles with a calibre of less than .240 inches or a\nmuzzle energy of less than 1,700 foot pounds. In respect of England and Wales, advice\non the 1963 Act can be obtained from E Division, Home Office, 50 Queen Anne's Gate,\nLondon SW1H 9AT. In respect of Scotland, advice on the deer legislation can be\nobtained from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, Pentland\nHouse, 47 Robbs Loan, Edinburgh, EH14 1TW or the Red Deer Commission,\nKnowsley, 82 Pairfield Road, Inverness, IV3 SLH.\n(d) It should also be established that the land areas over which an applicant intends to shoot\nare suitable from a safety point of view for the class of weapon which it is proposed\nto use (see paragraph 6.22).\n(e) A certificate for a handgun with ammunition should not be granted (except in very rare\ncases) unless the applicant has regular and legitimate opportunity of using the weapon\neg for target practice as a member of a pistol shooting club. Certificates should not,\nhowever, be issued for \"fast draw\" competitions for which adequate non-convertible\nimitation firearms are readily available.\n(f) An applicant wishing to obtain a certificate for a smooth-bore gun with a magazine\ncapable of holding more than two cartridges must demonstrate a reason applicable to\na larger capacity smooth-bore gun. There are relatively few instances in which a\nlimited capacity smooth-bore gun will not serve as well. Claypigeon shooting, for\nexample, does not require a participant to discharge more than two shots before\nreloading and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the use of the larger\ncapacity weapon to take wildlife other than under certain conditions (see subparagraph\nb above). However, an application to use such a gun, for example, for controlling\nwood pigeons and similar pests on a farm or for practical target shooting by a member\nof a relevant organisation, should normally represent a good reason for the grant of a\ncertificate.\n(g) If the applicant wishes to obtain a certificate for the purpose of collecting firearms\nand/or ammunition, the factors set out in paragraphs 6.13 and 6.14 should be considered\ncarefully.\n(h) Applications for the grant of a firearm certificate for the applicant's protection or that\nof his premises should be refused on the grounds that firearms are not regarded as an\nacceptable means of protection in this country. This principle should be maintained\neven in the case of applications from representatives of banks and firms who desire to\nprotect valuables or large quantities of money.\n(i) Each application should be considered on its merits in respect of the total number of\nfirearms to be held on the certificate, the number of firearms of particular calibres\napplied for and the applicant's security arrangements. The \"good reason\" requirement\nwill need to be satisfactorily demonstrated in respect of each firearm. Thorough\nenquiries must be undertaken regardless of whether this involves making enquiries\noutside the applicant's police area. It is also desirable to have written confirmation of\nan applicant's club membership status or permission to shoot over land. No arbitrary\nlimit should be applied to the number of firearms which may be held. Where firearms\nof a similar calibre are to be used for different purposes, the applicant will need to\nsatisfy the police as to the purpose for which each is required. It should be recognised\n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthat target shooters may require several firearms for various disciplines and that persons\nshooting for sporting purposes may require different weapons for variations in game\nand terrain.\n(j) It is not possible to give firm guidance on the amount of ammunition which may be\nauthorised by a certificate. Each case should be dealt with on its merits. While account\nshould be taken of the fact that it is normal practice to purchase ammunition by batches\nfor consistency of performance and that reloading or buying ammunition in bulk is\ncheaper, chief officers will wish to pay regard to the risks attendant upon unnecessarily\nlarge quantities of ammunition being held on private premises. Where larger quantities\nare authorised, particular attention must also be given to the security arrangements.\nThe evidence submitted by the Home Office to the Home Affairs Committee for its inquiry\ninto the Possession of Handguns makes the following observations about current arrangements\nfor assessing an applicant's personal suitability and the requirement that the application be\ncountersigned by a person known to the applicant:36 \nPersonal suitability\n65. In cases where the prohibition under section 21 does not apply, the chief officer\nmust decide on the circumstances of the case whether an applicant with a criminal record\nshould be granted a certificate. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply to\napplications for firearm certificates and a person applying for a certificate must declare any\nconviction by a Court at home or abroad, however old or minor.\n66 The police are sometimes required to make delicate decisions about issuing firearm\ncertificates to people who have criminal records or to people who are thought to have, or to\nhave had, criminal associates but have no conviction. More difficult than these can be cases\nin which the individual is thought to be suffering from mental disorder of some kind,\nespecially ones in which there is no formal indication of it (for instance, no admissions to a\nmental hospital or other medical evidence).\n67. The Government does not give the police central guidance about circumstances of\nthat kind. It is up to chief officers to exercise their statutory discretion. An applicant who\nis dissatisfied with the police decision can take the matter to appeal, or seek judicial review\nof it.\nCountersigning certificate applications\n68. The Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1989 require each application for a firearm certificate\nto be countersigned by a person who is resident in Great Britain, is not a relative of.the\napplicant, and has known them personally for at least two years. The countersignatory must\nalso be a Member of Parliament, Justice of the Peace, minister of religion, doctor, lawyer,\nestablished civil servant, bank officer or \"person of similar standing\".\n69. These categories of person are the same as those who can countersign applications\nfor passports. In practice, we understand that police forces have over the last few years, and\nfollowing a recommendation of the Firearms Consultative Committee, interpreted the phrase\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n36 HC 393-II Session 1995-96 p42\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n\"person of similar standing\" fairly widely so that countersignatures are accepted from a wide\nvariety of people so long as they are of good character and otherwise qualified under the\nRules.\n70. The countersignatory has to confirm that the information which the applicant has\nprovided is, so far as they know, true and to vouch for the passport-size photographs which\nthey provide. The 1989 Rules brought in a further requirement that they should confirm that\nthey \"know of no reason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess a firarm\".\nNotes on the back of the form tell them that they should \"bear in mind the character, conduct\nand mental condition of the applicant in so far as they are relevant. . . \"\n71. The countersignatory may be the applicant's doctor, and in many cases the doctor\ndoes countersign. But a doctor's signature is not required by law.\nShotgun Certificates\nAs the evidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to\nthe Cullen Inquiry noted,37 the rules which govern the grant or renewal of shotgun certificates\nare slightly less exacting than those concerning firearm certificates.\nSections 28(1), 28(1A), 28(1B) and 28(1C) of the Firearms Act 1968 provide that:\n(1)Subject to subsection (1A) below, a shot gun certificate shall be\ngranted or, as the case may be, renewed by the chief officer of police if he\nis satisfied that the applicant can be permitted to possess a shot gun without\ndanger to the public safety or to the peace.\n(1A) No such certificate shall be granted or renewed if the chief officer\nof police-\n(a) has reason to believe that the applicant is prohibited by this Act\nfrom possessing a shot gun; or\n(h) is satisfied that the applicant does not have a good reason for\npossessing, purchasing or acquiring one.\n(1B) For the purposes of paragraph (h) of subsection (1 A) above an\napplicant shall, in particular, be regarded as having a good reason if the gun\nis intended to be used for sporting or competition purposes or for shooting\nvermin; and an application shall not be refused by virtue of that paragraph\nmerely because the applicant intends neither to use the gun himself nor to\nlend it for anyone else to use.\n(1C) A person under the age of eighteen shall be regarded for the\npurposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1A) as not having a good reason\nfor possessing, purchasing or acquiring a shot gun if it is his intention to use\nthe shot gun, at any time before he attains the age of eighteen, for a purpose\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n37 above, p\n36\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nnot authorised by the European weapons directive.\nThe Home Office guidance notes that:38\n7.6 The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 revised the criteria set out in section 28 of the\n1968 Act for the grant or renewal of a shot gun certificate so as to allow chief officers of\npolice more discretion to make enquiries into applications. It is important to note how the\ncriteria differ from those in respect of Applications under section 1 of the Act. No certificate\nshall be granted or renewed if the chief officer of police:\n(a) has reason to believe that the applicant is prohibited by the Act from possessing a\nshot gun; or\n(b) is satisfied that the applicant does not have a good reason for possessing, purchasing\nor acquiring one.\nSection 28(1B) of the Act, as amended, provides for sporting and competition purposes or the\nshooting of vermin to be regarded as good reasons for possessing a shot gun and that an\napplication may not be refused merely because an applicant wants to possess but not use a\nshot gun. This is likely to be the case where the shot gun is of special significance to.the\napplicant, such as an heirloom or of some other sentimental value. However, the Act does\nNOT require the applicant to make out a good case for being granted a certificate but rather\nextends the chief officer's ground for refusing one. A chief officer should therefore need to\nmake further enquiries only where it comes to his notice that there may be genuine doubts\nabout an applicant's reasons for possessing a shot gun.\n7.7 If the grant of a certificate is not so precluded, the chief officer of police has to satisfy\nhimself that the applicant can be permitted to possess a shot gun without danger to the public\nsafety or the peace. This may necessitate an interview and consideration of his security\narrangements. Where a visit to the applicant's home is considered necessary, this should,\nwhere possible, be made by prior appointment. Applicants usually provide a telephone\nnumber where they can be contacted for this purpose. This information is requested on form\n103.\n7.8 The words \"danger to the public safety or to the peace\" also appear in section 27(1)\ndealing with the grant of a firearm certificate. A conviction for a criminal offence which does\nnot result in a sentence to which section 21 applies should not be an automatic bar to the issue\nof a shot gun certificate but convictions for some offences might cast doubt on the ability of\nan applicant to have shot guns without endangering the public safety. Any relevant\ninformation known to the police about the applicant such as mental illness or intemperate\nhabits may be taken into account, but it should be borne in mind that supporting evidence may\nhave to be produced in court if a refused applicant appeals to the Crown Court (in England\nand Wales) or the Sheriff (in Scotland). Forces will normally be expected to give reasons for\nrefusing an application for a shot gun certificate.\nUnder Section 28(2A) of the 1968 Act, a shotgun certificate must specify the description of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n38 Firearms law: Guidance to the Police - Home Office (1989) p87-89 \n37\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthe shotguns to which it relates including, if known, the identification numbers of the guns.\nA shotgun certificate may, therefore relate to more than one weapon, whereas a firearm\ncertificate authorises the possession of the one particular weapon specified on the certificate\nand ammunition for that weapon.\nVariation of Firearm Certificates\nSection 29 of the Firearms Act 1968 enables a chief officer of police for the area in which\nthe holder of a firearm certificate resides to vary, by notice in writing, the conditions under\nwhich the certificate is held. The certificate holder may also apply to the chief officer of\npolice for a variation of these conditions and may appeal to the Courts (the Crown Court in\nEngland and Wales and the sheriff court in Scotland) against the chief officer's refusal to vary\nthem.\nRevocation of Firearm and Shotgun Certificates\nSection 30 of the Firearms Act 1968 permits the revocation of firearm and shotgun\ncertificates in the following circumstances:\n30 Revocation of certificates\n(1) A firearm certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of police\nfor the area in which the holder resides if-\n(a) the chief officer is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act\nfrom possessing a firearm to which section 1 of this Act applies or is\nof intemperate habits or unsound mind, or is otherwise unfitted to be\nentrusted with such a firearm; or\n(b) the holder fails to comply with a notice under section 29(1) of this\nAct requiring him to deliver up the certificate.\n(2) A shot gun certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of\npolice if he is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act from\npossessing a shot gun or cannot be permitted to possess a shot gun without\ndanger to the public safety or to the peace.\nA person aggrieved by the revocation of a certificate may appeal to the Courts against the\ndecision.\nThe circumstances in which firearm and shotgun certificates may be revoked are not exactly\nthe same as those in which an application for the initial grant or renewal of a certificate may\nbe rejected. In particular, there is no clear power for the police to revoke a certificate on the\ngrounds that the \"good reason\" for which it was initially granted no longer applies. The\nevidence submitted by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary to the\n38\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nCullen Inquiry noted this and observed that:39\nUnless a certificate holder sustains a criminal conviction during the currency\nof his certificate, the conditions for revocation may not apply in practice.\nThere are not, compared to the overall number of certificates, a large\nnumber of revocations.\nSecurity.\nThe police have no explicit statutory right to inspect applicants' proposed storage\narrangements. They do, however, have a general discretion to grant, renew or revoke\ncertificates, under the provisions of the 1968 Act set out in earlier in this Chapter. In its fifth\nannual report the Firearms Consultative Committee, which was set up under the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 to keep the provisions of the Firearms Acts under review and make\nrecommendations for procedural improvements and legislative amendments, rejected a\nsuggestion that the police be given a specific statutory right to carry out security inspections\non applicants' premises. The Committee considered that there should be no explicit power,\nbut that it was reasonable for the police to inspect an applicants' security40 \nThe evidence submitted by the Home Office to the Home Affairs Committee for its inquiry\ninto the Possession of Handguns made the following observations about the security of\nfirearms, in the context of police officers' assessments of whether or not an applicant for a\nfirearm certificate could be permitted to have a firearm in his possession without danger to\nthe public safety or to the police:41\n 58. There are two main considerations which the police must have in mind when\nconsidering whether an applicant might, if granted a firearm certificate, be a danger to public\nsafety or to the peace. The first has to do with the security with which the applicant will keep\nany guns or ammunition he is allowed to possess.\n59. Standard condition 4 of the firearm certificate places holders under a duty to take\nall \"reasonable' security precautions, both when the firearm and ammunition are in store at\nhome or elsewhere and when they are in use or in transit. The Home Office has issued a\npamphlet which gives guidance to the police and public on what this means in practice.\n60. There is no bar on holders of firearm certificates keeping their firearms and\nammunition at home, provided that their certificates do not bear a condition which prevents\nthem from doing that. In practice, the vast majority of certificate holders do keep their\nfirearms and ammunition at home, in secure conditions which satisfy the police that they am\nmeeting their legal duty to take all reasonable precautions for their security.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n39 Dep/3 3283 para 79\n40 HC 488 Session 1993-94 p24\n41 HC 393-II Session 1995-96 p42\n39\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n61. The police will generally visit people who are applying for their first firearm\ncertificate, both in order to assess their security arrangements at first hand and to interview\nthem generally about their reasons for wanting to have a firearm and their general background.\nThis allows an assessment of the individual's personal suitability, which is the second issue\nrelating to public safety.\n2. Lord Cullen's Recommendations\nLord Cullen's observations and recommendations on the certification system relating to\nfirearms as defined by Section 1 of the Firearms Act 1968 are set out in detail in Chapter 8\nof his report. He made the following remarks about arrangements for assessing the suitability\nof applicants for firearm certificates:42\n8.56 I use the term \"suitability\" as a convenient expression to cover the provision in section\n27(1) that a firearm certificate is to be granted by the chief officer of police if he is satisfied\nthat the applicant \"can be permitted to have it (the relevant firearm or ammunition) in his\npossession without danger to the public safety or to the peace\" (in so far as this turns on the\npersonal suitability of the applicant); and the provision that the certificate is not to be granted\nto a person whom the chief officer of police \"has reason to believe .... to be of intemperate\nhabits or unsound mind, or to be for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with such a firearm\".\nSection 30(1) enables the chief officer to revoke if he is \"satisfied that the holder ... is of\nintemperate habits or unsound mind. or is otherwise unfitted to be entrusted with such a\nfirearm\".\n8.57 This language is substantially the same as that contained in the Firearms Act 1920,\nwhich was the first legislation for regulating the possession of firearms. Although the\nlanguage is of long-standing it contains a number of difficulties which were discussed at the\nInquiry. These may be summarised as follows.\n8.58 The intention behind the proviso to section 27(1) seems to have been to prohibit the\ngranting of a certificate in certain definite situations; whereas under the leading provision of\nthat sub-section the chief officer of police was to have some discretion in deciding whether\nthe applicant could be permitted to have the relevant firearm or ammunition in his possession.\nIf he was so satisfied he was bound to grant the certificate.\n8.59 However, the matter is not as simple as that. It is not difficult to understand why\n\"unsound mind\" should appear in the proviso. Even if it is wider than insanity and\nencompasses any degree of mental instability, it will be normal for it to be presumed that a\nperson is of sound mind until the contrary appears. It is also a matter which can be\nreasonably closely defined. The same perhaps may be said of \"intemperate habits\" which\nappears to embrace not merely lack of temperance in regard to alcohol or drugs but also\nimmoderate conduct whatever be the cause (see P J Clarke and J W Ellis, The Law relating\nto Firearms (1981) at pages 96-97). Thus far the terms of the proviso appear to deal with\ncases which are irrespective of whether there is danger to the public safety or to the peace in\nthe applicant being permitted to have possession of the firearm or ammunition in question.\nHowever, there is already an overlap between cases which fall foul of the proviso and those\nwhich do not meet the leading provision. When one comes to the expression \"unfitted to be\nentrusted with such a firearm\" it is clear that there is a substantial overlap, and it is in regard\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n42 ibid p94-95\n40\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nto a matter which appears to be primarily a question of judgment. It suggests that the\narrangement of concepts with which the sub-section deals is not of the happiest.\n41\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n8.60 The meaning of \"unfitted\"...... has been little discussed in decisions and text books. It\nis clearly a neglected corner in firearms legislation. When one looks at the Guidance to the\nPolice one finds that after para 6.6 which recites the terms of the proviso the text concentrates\non the question of danger to public safety and to the peace (6.9). This seems to overlook the\npoint that the phrase \"unfitted\"...... is of wide import.\n8.61 When one turns to section 30(1) one finds not merely that there is no provision for\nrevocation where the good reason has ceased but also that the power to revoke is limited to\na situation in which the proviso in section 27(1) would have applied; with the two additional\npeculiarities, that section 30(1) uses \"Is satisfied that\" rather than the somewhat weaker\nexpression \"has reason to believe\"; and that the word \"otherwise\" now appears in front of the\nword \"unfitted\". The mismatching between sections 30(1) and section 27(1) is highlighted by\nthe fact that in the case of shot guns the same test of danger is used both in regard to the\ngranting of the application (section 28(1)) and in regard to the question of revocation (section\n30(2)).\n8.62 1 am bound to say that I consider that it is high time that the language of sections 27\nand 30 is revised in order to achieve a logical and consistent arrangement.\n8.63 However, there is at this point a consideration which is of greater moment in regard to\nthe protection and safety of the public which lies at the heart of the legislation. The\ncircumstances of the present case seem to me to demonstrate the need for a positive\nrequirement that the applicant should be a person who is fit to be entrusted with the relevant\nfirearm and ammunition, so that where the information on this is not seen as persuasive the\ncertificate should be withheld. This entails some reorientation of section 27(1) with the result\nthat the matters as to which the chief officer of police is to be positively satisfied would\ninclude the fitness of the applicant.\n8.64 At the same time I am conscious that, without prejudice to what a court may decide are\nthe limits of \"fitness\", it would be desirable if some guidance could be given to the police and\nto applicants. I am aware that a number of police forces provide leaflets for the guidance of\nshooters but, so far as I have been able to discover, there is no national guidance on the\nsubject. The expression \"unfitted\", in the context in which it is used, seems to me to be\ncapable of embracing deficiencies not merely in physical or mental ability but also in a\nresponsible attitude to such matters as compliance with the legislation, the safe keeping and\nhandling of firearms and elementary co-operation with the licensing authority.\n8.65 As regards section 30(1) 1 consider that it should be brought into full correspondence\nwith section 27(1) with the result that a certificate may be revoked also when the chief officer\nof police is satisfied that the holder cannot be permitted to possess the firearm or ammunition\nwithout danger to the public safety or to the peace.\n42\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nLord Cullen's view of the current requirement for counter-signatories was as follows:43\n8.81 I consider that the current requirement for a counter-signatory should be abolished and\nshould be replaced by a system for the obtaining of references as one source of information\nfor the police. The object of such a system would be to provide the police not with negative\nbut with positive statements about the applicant without imposing on referees the burden of\ndeclaring that the applicant was a fit person to the best of their knowledge and belief. I\nconsider that there should be two referees, neither of whom should be a member of the\napplicant's family. They should both be persons of good character. One of them should be\nan official of an approved shooting club of which the applicant is a member. The other\nshould be a person who is not a member of any shooting club. The latter should have known\nthe applicant personally for at least 2 years. Each of the referees should be expected to supply\na reference to the police in the form of answers to a questionnaire designed to bring out the\nextent and nature of their knowledge of the applicant. with particular reference to his character,\nconduct and mental condition. It would be open to the police to reject a referee who did not\nappear to have adequate knowledge of the applicant. A reference would normally be treated\nas confidential but might require to be made available to the applicant in the event of an\nappeal.\n8.82 I do not support the submission that such referees should be made responsible for\nreporting any subsequent material change of circumstances or be subject to prosecution for\nfailing to do so. It would. in my view, impose such a burden as to be counter-productive.\n8.83 If a system of referees were introduced it would be for the police to decide in the\nparticular case whether and to what extent a reference should be followed up by further\nenquiry of the referees.\nLord Cullen also made the following comments about police powers in relation to firearm\ncertification:44\n8.14 It was pointed out in a number of the submissions that the police do not have an\nexplicit statutory power to insist on inspection of security arrangements prior to the grant or\nrenewal of a firearm certificate or at any time during the life of the certificate. They also do\nnot have an explicit power to insist on inspection of the firearms held. I am not persuaded\nthat it is appropriate to go as far as to grant police a statutory power of entry and inspection\nin connection with the initial grant or subsequent renewal. No doubt the police require to be\nsatisfied in regard to the security arrangements. If the police cannot obtain satisfactory\ninformation about the security arrangements, or for that matter the firearms held, the remedy\nshould be the refusal of the application. If necessary, legislative provision for this can be\nmade. As regards the position during the currency of the certificate I do not consider that\nthere are sufficient grounds to arm the police with a general right to insist on entry and\ninspection regardless of whether there is any apprehension of danger to the public.\n8.15 The Association of Chief Police Officers for England and Wales (ACPO) submitted that\npolice officers should be given the power to enter premises and seize firearms without warrant\non refusal, revocation or suspension of a firearm certificate. The Association of Chief Police\nOfficers in Scotland (ACOPS) submitted that police officers should be given a power to seize\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n43 ibid. p98\n44 ibid p86-87\n43\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\ncertificates, firearms and ammunition prior to any revocation. It may be noted that where a\nfirearm certificate is revoked under section 30(1 )(a) or (2) of the 1968 Act the chief officer\nof police may require the certificate holder by notice in writing to surrender the certificate and\nany firearms and ammunition which are in his possession by virtue of it. Failure to comply\nis an offence (section 12(1) and (2) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988). This would\njustify an application for a warrant to search premises and seize firearms and ammunition\nunder section 46 of the 1968 Act which applies where there is reasonable grounds for\nsuspecting that a relevant offence has been, is being or is about to be committed. However,\nleaving that particular case to one side, there do not appear to me to be explicit powers\nenabling police officers to seize certificates. firearms and ammunition where there is no\nquestion of an offence but where there is reasonable ground for suspecting that there is a\nsubstantial risk to the safety of the public. At present the police have to rely on the co-\noperation of the holder. I consider that provision should be made for such a power to be\ngranted by a justice of the peace or, in Scotland. the sheriff, on the same lines as section 46.\nThe powers under section 46 should also be extended to any civilian licensing and enquiry\nofficer who is authorised in writing by the Chief Constable for that purpose.\n8.16 1 have also noted that while such civilian officers now have the right to possess\nfirearms in the course of their duty without the need to hold a firearm certificate covering\nthem, they do not have the same powers as police officers to inspect dealers' registers and\npremises and approved clubs. I agree with the view that this is an area which needs to be\ndealt with in the process of making civilisation effective.\nThe full list of Lord Cullen's recommendations is set out in his report's concluding chapter.\nMany of his recommendations are concerned with, and can be implemented by changes in the\nHome Office guidance to the police rather than by primary legislation. Those\nrecommendations requiring legislation are as follows:\n4. The power of search with warrant under section 46 of the Firearms\nAct 1968 should be extended to cases in which there is reasonable\nground for suspecting that there is a substantial risk to the safety of the\npublic; and to include in such cases the power to seize and detain any\nfirearm certificate which may he found.\n5. The power of search with warrant under section 46 of the Firearms\nAct 1968 should be extended to any civilian licensing and enquiry officer\nwho is authorised in writing for that purpose by the Chief Constable.\n6. The powers enjoyed by police officers to inspect dealers' registers\nand premises and approved clubs should he extended to civilian\nlicensing and enquiry officers who are authorised in writing for that\npurpose by the Chief Constable.\n9. Section 30(1) of the Firearms Act 1968 should he amended so as to\nprovide for-\n- the revocation of a firearm certificate on the ground that the chief\nofficer of police is satisfied that the holder does not have a good\nreason for having in his possession, or for purchasing or\nacquiring, the firearm or ammunition in respect of which the\n44\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\ncertificate is held; and for partial revocation; and\n- in the case of the revocation of a firearm certificate in respect of\nthe ammunition to which it relates, the power to substitute\ndifferent quantities.\n11. Every bolder of a firearm certificate should he required to be a\nmember of at least one approved club; and the certificate should specify\nthe approved club or dubs of which he or she is a member and the\nwhich he or she intends to use in each of them.\n15. Explicit statutory provision should he made for the laying down\nof criteria for the approval of clubs for the purpose of section 15 of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Act 1988.\n16. The language of section 30(1) of the Firearms Act 1968 should be\nbrought into full correspondence with that of section 27(1); and each\nrevised in order to achieve a logical and consistent arrangement.\nThe Government has accepted all of these recommendations.45 In his statement to the House\nof Commons on the day the Cullen report and the Government's response were published the\nHome Secretary said:46\nLord Cullen has made 23 recommendations for\nstrengthening the regulatory controls on the\nownership and licensing of all guns. We accept\nthem all. The Government's detailed response has\nbeen placed in the Library. There are seven\nrecommendations for improving the way in which\nthe police handle all applications for firearms\ncertificates, a further eight recommendations deal\nwith the grounds for obtaining a firearms\ncertificate, and eight recommendations are about the\nsuitability of individuals to hold firearms.\nI draw particular attention to the following\nrecommendations: in future, anyone applying for a\nfirearms certificate should be assessed against a\nchecklist of criteria for suitability, a clear burden\nshould be placed on the applicant to show that he\nis fit to have a gun, a new power should be created\nto enable the police to revoke a certificate where\nthere is no longer a \"good reason\" for having a\nfirearm, and the grounds on which an appeal\nagainst the refusal of a certificate can be made\nshould be significantly limited. Taken together,\nthose 23 recommendations add up to a drastic\nstrengthening of controls on gun ownership.\nIn addition to Lord Cullen's proposals, we intend to\nintroduce four further measures. First, we shall\nmake it a requirement for all handgun shooters to\nobtain a certificate in order to fire a handgun at a\ngun club. Secondly, we shall make it an offence to\nfail to notify the police whenever a firearm or\nshotgun is sold, transferred, deactivated or\ndestroyed. Thirdly, we propose to ban the sales of\nguns through the post. In future, it will be\nunlawful to transfer a gun from one person to\nanother, except in person.\nFourthly, one of the most shocking and\ndistressing features of the tragic events in Dunblane\nwas the use of expanding ammunition, which is\ndesigned to cause the maximum injury. There is no\npossible justification at all for it to be available for\npeople whose only authority is for target shooting.\nIn future, therefore, it will be illegal to possess\nexpanding ammunition except for the purposes of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n45 The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 - The Government Response\nCm 3393 October 1996 \n46 HC Deb Vol 282 c831-832 16.10.1996\n45\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nshooting deer, in accordance with the Deer Act\n1991.\nThe current law and practice concerning gun clubs and the Government's proposals for the\nlicensing and regulation of pistol and rifle clubs under Part II and Clauses 35 and 36 of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Bill are set out elsewhere in this paper.\n3. Regulation of Firearms and Ammunition - Part III of the Bill\nProhibition of Expanding Ammunition\nClause 25 of the Bill is designed to prohibit expanding ammunition by adding a category of\n\"ammunition which incorporates a missile designed or adapted to expand on impact\" to the\nlist of weapons and ammunition which are subject to general prohibition under Section 5(1A)\nof the 1968 Act and can only be possessed, bought acquired, sold or transferred with the\nauthority of the Secretary of State. Clause 26 will amend Section 5A(4) of the 1968 Act,\nproviding an exception to the prohibition on expanding ammunition by permitting its\ncontinuing use by people who are authorised by firearm certificates which specify that it is\nto be used only for the purpose of lawfully shooting deer or controlling vermin. \n \nThis provision is one of the measures on which the Government said it proposed to take\naction in addition to the recommendations made by Lord Cullen set out in the previous\nsection of this paper. In its initial response the Government said that the exception to the\nprohibition on expending ammunition would extend only to shooting deer.47 The use of\nfirearms to shoot deer is controlled in England and Wales under the Deer Act 1991 and in\nScotland under the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959, as amended by the Deer (Scotland)\n(Amendment) Act 1982. \nIn his report, Lord Cullen made the following remarks about hollow-point ammunition:48 \n    \n9.115 During the course of the inquiry there was some controversy as to\nthe status and acceptability of hollow-point ammunition which is commonly\nused in target shooting in Great Britain. The object of such a bullet is to\nmaximise the transmission of energy to achieve \"stopping power\" and\nminimise over penetration. As part of his evidence to the Inquiry Mr Penn\nexplained that it was undesirable in police or self-defence use that a bullet\nshould exit from its target, or exit with any significant residual energy. since\nthis placed innocent third parties at risk. It was also desirable that bullets\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n47 HC Deb Vol 282 c 832 16.10.1996; Cm 3392 p8\n48 Cm 3386 p131\n46\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthat miss their intended targets should penetrate wood. brick, etc fully so\nthat risks to third parties were reduced. As I recorded in chapter 3 of this\nreport this type of ammunition formed part of what Thomas Hamilton\nbrought with him to the school. On balance I am not satisfied that I should\nmake any recommendation in regard to the availability of such ammunition.\nNotification of the transfer or disposal of firearms \nClauses 27 to 29 are concerned with shotguns as well as firearms. Clause 27 applies where,\n\"in the United Kingdom\" a firearm or ammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act applies\nor a shotgun is transferred to another person who is neither a registered firearms dealer nor\na person entitled to purchase or acquire the firearm or ammunition without a certificate.\nClause 27(2) provides that in such cases:\na) the transferee must produce to the transferor the certificate entitling him\nto purchase or acquire, the firearm or ammunition, being transferred;\nb) the transferor must comply with any instructions contained in the\ncertificate produced by the transferee;\nc) the transferor must hand the firearm or ammunition to the transferee, and\nthe transferee must receive it, in person\n\"Firearm or ammunition\" in clause 27(2) is presumably intended to include shotguns, as the\nClause as a whole applies to the transfer of shotguns, although this is not entirely clear. In\naddition, the Clause refers to the \"United Kingdom\", which includes Northern Ireland,\nalthough neither the Bill itself nor the 1968 Act to which the Clause refers extend to Northern\nIreland. \nClause 28 similarly applies where \"in the United Kingdom\", any firearm to which section 1\napplies is sold, let on hire, lent or given; or any shotgun is sold, let on hire or given, or lent\nfor a period of more than 72 hours. It will require any party to the transfer who is the holder\nof a certificate relating to the firearm in question to give notice to the chief officer of police\nwho granted his certificate within 7 days of the transfer. The notice will have to contain a\ndescription of the firearm in question , including its identification number, if any, the nature\nof the transaction and the name and address of the other party. It will have to be sent by\nregistered post or the recorded delivery service.\nClause 29 is intended to require the holders of firearm or shotgun certificates to notify the\nchief officer of police who granted the certificate within 7 days of the firearm or shotgun\nbeing de-activated, destroyed or lost, or of ammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act\napplies and to which the firearm certificate relates being lost. Where the weapon or\nammunition is lost, notification will be necessary whether the loss occurred as a result of theft\nor otherwise. The notice will have to describe the firearm or ammunition, giving the\n47\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nidentification number, if any, and will have to be sent by registered post or the recorded\ndelivery service. \nA person who fails to comply with the requirements of Clause 27(2), who fails to give the\nnotice required by Clause 28 or who fails, without reasonable excuse to give the notice\nrequired by Clause 29 will commit an offence. The penalties for these offences are set out\nin Clause 30. The offences are all punishable, if committed in relation to a firearm or\nammunition to which Section 1 of the 1968 Act applies, by up to six months' imprisonment\nand a £5,000 fine following summary conviction and by up to five years' imprisonment and\na fine following conviction on indictment. If committed in relation to a shotgun the offence\nwill be punishable on summary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment and a £5,000\nfine.\nChanges to Firearm and Shotgun Certification Procedures\nClause 31 of the Bill sets out the manner in which applications for firearm certificates and\nshotgun certificates are to be made. It will replace current provisions in Section 26 of the\nFirearms Act 1968, which cover both firearm and shotgun certificates, with a Section 26A\nconcerned with applications for firearm certificates and Section 26B concerned with\napplications for shotgun certificates. Like the present Section 26, the new Sections will enable\nthe Secretary of State to make rules under Section 53 of the 1968 Act requiring applicants\nfor firearm and shotgun certificates to provide up to four photographs and to fulfill certain\nother requirements.\nWhere shotgun certificates are concerned these will be much the same as they are at present,\nwith applicants being required to provide verification by another person in a prescribed\nmanner of prescribed particulars, and the person verifying those particulars making a\nstatement that he knows of no reason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess\na shotgun.\nWhere firearm certificates are concerned rules made under the new Section 26A will require\nan applicant to provide two referees (rather than one as at present) who may be required to\nverify prescribed particulars in a prescribed manner, make statements that they know of no\nreason why the applicant should not be permitted to possess a firearm and provide \"such other\nstatements or information in connection with the application as may be prescribed\"\n The period of time for which a firearm or shotgun currently remains in force was increased\nfrom three years to five years in 1994 by the Firearms (Period of Certificate) Order 199449\nand the Firearms (Scotland) (Amendment) Rules 199450. Schedule 2(4) of the Bill inserts a\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n49 SI 1994/2614 \n50 SI 1994/3198\n48\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nnew Section 28A into the Firearms Act 1968, subsection(1) of which will provide that:\nA certificate shall, unless previously revoked or cancelled, continue in force\nfor five years from the date on which it was granted or last renewed, but\nshall be renewable for a further period of five years by the chief officer of\npolice for the area in which the holder resides. \nThe new Section 28A will also permit the Secretary of State to make orders substituting\nother periods for the five year period set out in subsection (1) This power will be exercisable\nby statutory instrument subject to annulment under the negative procedure. Such orders will\napply only to certificates granted or renewed after the date on which th order comes into\nforce.\nWhere a chief officer of police refuses to grant or renew a certificate there will be a right of\nappeal, as there is at present, to the Crown Court in England and Wales or the sheriff in\nScotland.\nWhere at present it is an offence under Section 26(5) of the 1968 Act (punishable by up to\nsix months' imprisonment and a £5,000 fine) for a person to make any statement which he\nknows to be false for the purpose of procuring, whether for himself or any other person, the\ngrant or renewal of a certificate, it will be a similarly punishable offence, by virtue of new\nSection 28A(7) of the 1968 Act for a person knowingly or recklessly to make any statement\nwhich is \"false in any material particular\" for such a purpose. \nClause 32 of the Bill will replace Section 27(1) of the Firearms Act 196851 with a new\nsubsection stating that a firearm certificate shall be granted where the chief officer of police\nis satisfied:\na) that the applicant is fit to be entrusted with a firearm to which Section 1 applies and is not a person\nprohibited by this Act from possessing such a firearm;\nb) that he has a good reason for having in his possession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or\nammunition in respect of which the application is made; and\nc) that in all the circumstances the applicant can be permitted to have the firearm or ammunition in his\npossession without danger to the public safety or to the peace.\nClause 33 of the Bill is designed to replace Section 30 of the Firearms Act 1968, which is\nconcerned with the revocation of firearm and shotgun certificates, with a number of new\nprovisions. Arrangement for the revocation of shotgun certificates, set out in a new Section\n30C, will not be significantly changed. A chief officer of police will, as now, be able to\nrevoke a shotgun certificate if he is satisfied that the holder is prohibited by the 1968 Act\nfrom possessing a shotgun or cannot be permitted to possess a shotgun without danger to the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n51 set out at p.3 above\n49\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\npublic safety or peace. A person aggrieved by the revocation of a shotgun certificate will be\nable to appeal under Section 44 of the 1968 Act.\nWhere firearm certificates are concerned a new Section 30A will enable a chief officer of\npolice to revoke a firearm certificate in the following circumstances:\n30A.-(1) A firearm certificate may be revoked by the chief officer of\npolice for the area in which the holder resides on any of the grounds\nmentioned in subsections (2) to (5) below.\n(2) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police has\nreason to believe-\n(a) that the holder is of intemperate habits or unsound mind or is\notherwise unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm; or\n(b) that the holder can no longer be permitted to have the firearm or\nammunition to which the certificate relates in his possession without danger\nto the public safety or to the peace.\n(3) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police is\nsatisfied that the holder is prohibited by this Act from possessing a firearm\nto which section I of this Act applies.\n(4) The certificate may be revoked if the chief officer of police is\nsatisfied that the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his\npossession, or for purchasing or acquiring, the firearm or ammunition which\nhe is authorised by virtue of the certificate to have in his possession or to\npurchase or acquire.\n(5) A firearm certificate may be revoked if the holder fails to comply\nwith a notice under section 29(1) of this Act requiring him to deliver up the\ncertificate.\nThe provision enabling a certificate to be revoked of the chief officer of police is satisfied\nthat the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his possession, or for purchasing\nor acquiring the firearm or ammunition authorised under the certificate is designed to\nimplement Lord Cullen's recommendation that greater consistency be achieved between the\nprovisions in Section 27(1) of the 1968 Act concerning the grant or renewal of firearm\ncertificates and those in Section 30 setting out the circumstances in which such certificates\nmay be revoked.52 A new Section 30B will also enable a firearm certificate to be partially\nrevoked (where the holder has more than one firearm) where the chief officer of police is\nsatisfied that the holder no longer has a good reason for having in his possession, or for\npurchasing or acquiring the firearm or ammunition to which it relates. Lord Cullen\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n52 Cm 3386 paras 8.31\n50\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nrecommended that provision be made for partial revocation.53 A person aggrieved by the\npartial or full revocation of a certificate will be able to appeal under Section 44 of the 1968\nAct unless, in the case of a full revocation, the revocation is the result of the holder's failure\nto comply with a notice under Section 29 (1) requiring him to deliver up his certificate so\nthat it can be varied. \nWhere a firearm or shotgun certificate is revoked the chief officer of police will, as now, have\nto write to the holder giving him notice that he is required, in the case of a full revocation,\nto surrender his certificate and in the case of a partial revocation, to deliver it up so that it\ncan be amended. It will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to\n£1,00054 for the holder to fail to comply with a notice within 21 days from the date of the\nnotice. \nPowers of Entry, Search and Seizure\nClause 34 of the Bill is designed to replace Section 46 of the Firearms Act 1968, which\nenables a magistrate (or a sheriff in Scotland) to grant a search warrant authorising police\nconstables to enter and search property and seize and detain firearms and ammunition. At\npresent the power to issue warrants is restricted to situations where a magistrate or sheriff is\nsatisfied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an\noffence relevant for the purpose of the Section (which is most offences under the Firearms\nAct 1968) has been, is being or is about to be committed.\nClause 34 will extend the power under Section 46 by also enabling warrants to be issued\nwhere there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that, in connection with a firearm or\nammunition, there is a danger to public safety or to the peace. Warrants will permit the\npowers of entry, search and seizure to be used by civilian officers as well as police\nconstables. As well as being able, as they are at present, to seize firearms or ammunition\nwhich they find on the premises or on people they reasonably suspect in relation to firearms\noffences, police constables (or civilian officers) will be able to seize imitation firearms,\nfirearm or shotgun certificates and any other document authorising the possession, purchase,\nacquisition, manufacture, sale or transfer of any firearm or ammunition. The extension to\nthese areas of the power of search under Section 46 of the 1968 Act was recommended by\nLord Cullen in his report (see p.41-42 above).55\nIt will be an offence punishable on summary conviction by up to six months' imprisonment\nand a £5,000 fine for a person to obstruct a constable or civilian officer in the exercise of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n53 ibid para 8.32\n54 Schedule 2(9) amending the Firearms Act 1968 Schedule 6 Part I\n55 Cm 3386 paras 8.15.8.16\n51\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nthese powers.\n52\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nD. Guns clubs - Part II of the Bill\n1. Background\nThe Home Affairs Select Committee Report on hand guns56 noted that there were 'over 2,500\nrifle or pistol clubs in England, Scotland and Wales' (para. 47). A footnote noted that there\nwere 2,118 rifle and pistol clubs \"approved\" by the Home Office/Scottish Office in England,\nWales and Scotland and it was estimated that there were several hundred \"non-approved\nclubs\".57\nThe Home Affairs Committee Report noted that many clubs did not have suitable sites for\nstorage (para. 66). It also noted that little or no research was available on the rate of offences\ncommitted in approved clubs compared to those committed in non-approved clubs (para. 95).\nFurther details on rifle and pistol clubs was given in an extract from the Home Office\nResearch and Planning Unit 1993 publication:58\nNumbers of clubs\nAccurate accounts of the numbers of rifle and pistol clubs are rare, but it has been possible\nto get some idea of their changes over the last quarter century by looking at how many clubs\nwere affiliated at different times to target shooting associations. The oldest is the National\nRifle Association (NRA), founded in 1859, which had 800 miniature, as well as full-bore, rifle\nclubs affiliated to it in 1920. In 1971 there were 580 clubs, 105 schools (mostly cadet corps),\nand 90 associations in membership. By 1980 the number of clubs had grown to 832 and in\n1990 the figure stood at 982. In 1992 there were 1,000 clubs and 90 cadet corps affiliated to\nthe NRA, representing some 60,000 shooters, and there were 4,500 individual members. In\naddition, there were affiliated associations. The NRA is now mostly concerned with full-bore\ncentre-fire firearms. The majority (about 84 per cent) of its rifle and pistol clubs are\napproved. Those clubs participating in the survey had an average (median) size of 40\nmembers.\nThe Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs broke away from the NRA in the early part of this\ncentury and in 1920 had 2,000 clubs affiliated to it. The Society later became the National\nSmall-Bore Rifle Association (NSRA) which, like the NRA, is a governing body recognized\nby the Sports Council. In 1965 there were about 4,000 clubs affiliated to the NSRA but by\n1970 this had dropped to 3,160 (of which 2,700 were approved). This represented club\nmembership of 111,000 (45,000 under 18 and 66,000 aged 18 and over). In 1971 3,600 clubs\nwere affiliated, some 650 of which were junior clubs. The number of affiliated clubs fell to\n1,990 in 1990. By 1992 the number was down to 1,600 representing club membership of\n25,000. In addition there were 35,000 belonging to junior clubs. The NSRA is primarily\nconcerned with air weapons, pistol and .22 rifle shooting. Some 79 per cent of its rifle and\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n56 HC 393 Session 1995/96 Possession of Hand Guns\n57 Footnote 121 pxvii\n58 Approval of rifle and pistol target shooting clubs: the effects of the new and revised criteria by John Martin\nCorkery 1993 Home Office Research and Planning Unit Paper 79\n53\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\npistol clubs are currently approved. The average (median) size of clubs participating in the\nsurvey affiliated to this association was about 24.\nThe National Pistol Association (NPA) broke away from the NRA about 1970 and by 1980\nthere were 106 clubs affiliated, with a membership of 5,000. The number of affiliations has\ncontinued to grow, to 390 clubs with a membership of 24,500 in 1985 and to 500 clubs with\na membership of 36,000 in 1992. Most of the clubs are thought to be approved. The average\n(median) size was 59 members.\nA memorandum by the Secretary of State and the Home Secretary for the Home Affairs\nSelect Committee summarised the current position as follows:\nRIFLE AND PISTOL CLUBS\n39. A member of a rifle or pistol club which has been approved by the Secretary of State\nmay possess (but not purchase or acquire) a rifle or pistol without a certificate when engaged\nas a member of that club in, or in connection with, target practice (section 15 of the 1988\nAct). The Secretary of State's approval of a club is subject to it meeting a number of criteria,\nrevised at the beginning of 1996, which are set out in a leaflet.\n40. There are a total of 2,118 approved clubs throughout Great Britain, 247 of them in\nScotland. To qualify for approval under section 15, a club must generally have at least 10\nmembers. They vary greatly in size and there are differing estimates of the total approved\nclub membership. Many individuals belong to more than one club.\n41. Full membership of an approved club effectively allows a person to shoot there, using\na rifle, revolver or pistol and the ammunition for it, without having a firearm certificate of\ntheir own. There are four categories of approval-for full and small-bore rifle and for full and\nsmall-bore pistol (including revolvers).\n42. The guns and ammunition which club members use need not necessarily belong to\nthe club - they might, for instance, be the personal property of another club member who\nholds a firearm certificate. A club member may also use his own firearms and ammunition,\nheld on a firearm certificate which the police have issued to him personally, at the club range.\n43. It is usual for clubs to have their own firearms and ammunition for members to use.\nThese are generally listed on a firearm certificate which the police have issued to a responsible\nmember of the club, for instance its Chairman or Secretary. Under section 32(2) of the 1968\nAct, the police issue this certificate without the usual fee.\n44. The club approval criteria require all new members to be sponsored by at least one\nexisting club member. If not already experienced with firearms, the new member must go\nthrough a period of probation lasting at least three months, during which they must be given\na course in the safe handling of firearms and attend and shoot regularly under supervision.\n45. Club approval lasts for six years. Most club approvals lapsed, and had to be renewed,\nin June 1992 (under section 15(9) of the 1988 Act). They therefore fall to be renewed again\nin 1998. Renewal requires the club to complete a form (\"form 124\") and submit it to the\nHome Office or Scottish Office via the police. This allows the police to inform the Home\nOffice or Scottish Office of how the club is run and whether they support the application.\n46. A club's approval can be withdrawn at any time if police or other reports indicate that\n54\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nit is not being run in accordance with the criteria or that there is any other difficulty with it.\nClubs are under no duty to pass to the police, or each other, information about members who\nresign or are expelled, or about would-be members whom they have turned away.\n47. The way in which clubs store their weapons and ammunition varies. Some have\nsecure stores at their ranges, at which they keep all their weapons and ammunition. In other\ncases, club members who have suitable firearm certificates keep the club's firearms and\nammunition securely at home. In all cases, the police must be satisfied that the arrangements\nmeet the requirement of the firearm certificate that firearm and ammunition be stored securely.\nIt is also a requirement of the club approval criteria that club firearms and ammunition \"be\nstored securely\".\n48. Some rifle and pistol clubs operate without approval under section 15. That is\nperfectly proper, as long as all those who shoot at these clubs hold individual firearm\ncertificates and abide by their terms and conditions, which will specify the guns that they can\nhave in their possession and where they can shoot with them. The Government has no\ninformation about the number and membership of clubs which operate in this way.\n2. Current legislation\nAn extract from a report from the Research and Planning Unit of the Home Office59 sets out\nthe rules for the approval of rifle and pistol clubs:\nApproval of rifle and pistol clubs by the Secretary of State\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was introduced following a review of firearms\nlegislation after the Hungerford incident, Under Section 15 (1) of the Act, members of rifle\nand pistol clubs which have been approved by the Secretary of State are exempted from\ncertain provisions of the legislation regarding firearms. Members of such clubs are permitted\nto possess firearms and ammunition when engaged as a member of the club, in or in\nconnection with target practice, without holding a firearm certificate (FAC). A similar\nexemption was introduced by the Firearms Act 1920, as was the concept of approved status,\nand this has been re-enacted by subsequent legislation. There is no requirement for a club to\nseek approval but only the members of approved clubs may benefit from the firearm certificate\nexemption. Section 15 of the 1988 Act came into force on I July 1989 and introduced, for\nthe first time, a six year approval and renewal period and a fee for approval. It gave the\npolice, also for the first time, the right of entry to club premises. It caused the approval of\nany club approved under Section 11(3) of the Firearms Act 1968 to expire on 30 June 1992.\nIn order to gain approval, a club is required to satisfy certain criteria laid down by the\nSecretary of State. Essentially, prior to Section 15 coming into force in 1989, the Secretary\nof State asked the police to check the bona fades of the club and confirm that a range safety\ncertificate covering the appropriate categories of weapons existed for each range used by the\nclub. Any premises where weapons were stored also had to be sufficiently secure.\nAlthough members of an approved club may possess firearms and ammunition without holding\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n59 Approval of Rifle and pistol target shooting clubs: the effects of the new and revised criteria - by John Martin\nCorkery 1993 Home Office Research and Planning Unit Paper 79 \n55\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\na certificate, the exemption does not extend to their purchase. In order for a club to purchase\nfirearms and ammunition a responsible officer of the club needs to hold an FAC. No fee is\npayable for an FAC granted to a responsible member of an approved club, nor is any fee\npayable for the variation or renewal of such a certificate.\nUnder Section 11(4) of the Firearms Act 1968 a person conducting or carrying on a miniature\nrifle range (whether as a rifle club or otherwise) or shooting gallery at which no firearms are\nused other than air weapons or miniature riles may possess, or purchase or acquire miniature\nrifles and ammunition for them without holding a firearm certificate. Any person may use any\nsuch miniature rifle and ammunition at such a range or gallery. Clubs operating as miniature\nrifle ranges under Section 11(4) of the Act would gain no benefit from approval under Section\n15(1).\nApproval therefore indicates only that the club is equipped for the supervision and induction\nof novice shooters; non-approved shooters are groups of certificate holders who meet to\npursue their shooting interests, and who do not seek to recruit novice shooters.\nThe criteria for approval were substantially revised in 1989 following two tragic shooting\nincidents in the Greater Manchester Police area. The then Home Secretary, David\nWaddington, felt that it was unacceptable for a casual caller to sign on at a club as a day or\ntemporary member and have immediate access to firearms and ammunition. Following\nconsultations with the Firearms Consultative Council,60 the revised criteria were issued to all\napproved clubs on 15 March 1990 in England and Wales and 5 April 1990 in Scotland. They\nwere reviewed again in 1995 and the concept of 'novice' membership abolished in favour of\n'probationary' membership from 1 January 1996. The period of probation was reduced from\nthe 6 months operative for 'novice' membership to three months. A new requirement that\nmembers, prospective members and guests must sign a declaration to say that they are not\nprohibited from possessing a firearm was added and the number of days on which a club\ncould allow non-members to shoot as individually supervised guests was increased from 4 a\nyear to 12.\nThe current criteria are set out in an extract from the Home Office leaflet Firearms: Approval\nof Pistol and Rifle Clubs:61\nCriteria for Approval\nClubs will not be granted approval unless they meet\nthe criteria which ore set out below. Approved\nclubs which cease to conform to the criteria can \nexpect that the approval will be withdrawn. The\ncriteria are:\n the club is a genuine rifle or pistol club with a\nwritten constitution;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n60 a statutory body set up under S.22 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 to review the provisions of the\nFirearms Acts and make recommendations for improving their working \n61 the Cullen inquiry noted that it would be preferable to have an explicit statutory provision for the issuing of\ncriteria for approval [para. 8.53] \n56\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\n the principal officers of the club are\nresponsible persons who can be entrusted with\nthe proper administration of the club;\n the club has at least 10 members of the time of\napplication for approval and at all times whilst,\napproved unless, exceptionally, the Secretary of\nState determines that there are special\ncircumstances which justify a lesser number;\n members must be of good character;\n members, prospective members and guests\nmust be asked to sign a declaration to say that\nthey are not prohibited from possessing a\nfirearm or ammunition by virtue of section 21\nof the Firearms Act 1968 (as amended).

The club must be a genuine rifle and\npistol club, set up for the purpose of target\npractice. The constitution of the club\nshould implement the requirements of the\ncriteria.\n2. Clubs should make their own\narrangements for assessing whether\nmembers or prospective members are of\ngood character. Police firearms licensing\ndepartments should not be asked to\ndisclose whether someone has a criminal\nrecord or not. Prospective members\nshould not be required to apply for a\nfirearm or shot gun certificate as a means\nof determining 'good character'. The\npolice will not normally grant a certificate\nbecause somebody is a probationary\nmember of a club.\n3. The National Associations are able to\nprovide advice on the construction and use\nof ranges. Clubs which are affiliated to\nthe National Rifle Association or the\nNational Small Bore Association will be\nable to obtain a safety certificate for their\nrange from the Ministry of Defence.\n4. Recognised coaching qualifications for the\npurposes of the Home and Scottish Office\ncriteria for approved clubs are\nGreat Brita in Target Shooting\nFederation - Coach Educator, Advanced\nCoach, Senior Coach and Primary Coach;\nNational Rifle Association - Club\nInstructor (Rifle), Club Instructor (Pistol)\nand Range Conducting Officer; and\nNational Small-bore Rifle Association -\nRange Conducting Officer, Range\nConducting Officers Assessor, Cadet Adult\nInstructor and Regional Coaches.\n5. The National Associations are able to give\nadvice on safety training courses for\nprobationary members.\n6. A club may end a probationer's\nmembership at any time or extend the\nprobationary period if it considers that this\nis necessary.\n7. The Secretary of State may, in exceptional\ncases such as university or college clubs -\nallow a club to have more probationary\nmembers than full members.\n8. Examples of recognised outside\norganisations whose members may be\nguest members of approved rifle and pistol\nclubs are Scouts and Guides, schools,\nRotary Clubs and Women's Institutes.\n9. Clubs can have non-shooting categories of\nmembership such as associate, family,\nsocial or honorary members. Such\nmembers are not covered by section 15 of\nthe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 and\nmust not, under any circumstances, have\nany access to firearms or ammunition.\nThe Cullen inquiry62 noted that unapproved clubs were not subject to any form of inspection:\n8.39 At the same time it has to be borne in mind that some rifle and\npistol clubs. the exact number of which is not known, operate without the\nneed for approval under section 15. In such clubs the participants should all\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n62 The Public Inquiry into the shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996 Cm 3386\n58\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nhave their own firearm certificates and are expected individually to abide by\ntheir terms and conditions. Such clubs are in themselves not subject to\nlegislation, and are not subject to any form of statutory inspection. Mr D J\nPenn pointed out that some of these \"clubs\" amount to no more than a\nmeans by which a group of people who share an interest in a certain type\nof firearm or competition get together on an informal basis on certain\noccasions during the year.\nPolice powers to visit and enter rifle clubs vary according to status; \"approved\" clubs can be\ninspected to ascertain whether the conditions on which approval is granted is being complied\nwith63 but there is no equivalent power to inspect non-approved clubs.64\nDetailed guidance to the police on rifle and pistol clubs and cadet corps was given in\nFirearms Law: Guidance to the Police HMSO 1989, Chapter 13. The Guidance covers\nmatters such as siting of ranges, security of club premises and administration of clubs, and\nnotes that general approval to Combined Cadet Forces, Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force\nand Air Training Corps has been granted under S.11(3) of the 1988 Act.\n3. The Cullen Report recommendations for gun clubs\nThe Cullen Report did not recommend the wholesale prohibition of guns, but considered\nimprovements to the certification system and discussed the need for each holder of a firearm\ncertificate to be a member of at least one approved club, and for approved clubs to keep a\nrecord of the activities of their members who are holders of firearm certificates, and to inform\nthe police of the termination of membership or non-attendance for a substantial period. The\nGovernment response to Cullen (Cm 3392) accepted the following recommendation on gun\nclubs:\n10. Each club which is approved for the purposes of section 15 of the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 should he required to maintain a register of the attendance of its\nmembers who are holders of firearm certificates, together with details as to the firearms\nwhich they used and the competitions in which they participated when they attended.\nThe Government accepts this recommendation. The approval criteria for clubs will be\namended (see recommendation 15).\n11. Every holder of a firearm certificate should be required to be a member of at least\none approved club; and the firearm certificate should specify the approved club or clubs\nof which he or she is a member and the firearms which he or she intends to use in each\nof them.\nThe Government accepts this recommendation, for holders of firearm certificates for target\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n63 S.15(5) of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 \n64 Home Affairs Select Committee Report Possession of Hand Guns HC 393 Session 1995/96 para. 96\n59\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nshooting. The Government will bring forward the necessary changes in primary legislation.\n12. Each approved club should be required to inform the police when a holder of a\nfirearm certificate has ceased to be a member of the club for whatever reason.\n13. Each approved club should be required to inform the police when a member who is\nthe holder of a firearm certificate has not attended a meeting of the club for a period of\na year.\n14. The proposal that each club should appoint a person to act as a liaison officer with\nthe police is endorsed.\nThe Government accepts these 3 recommendations and will amend the approval criteria for\nclubs (see recommendation 15).\n15. Explicit statutory provision should be made for the laying down of criteria for the\napproval of clubs for the purpose of section 15 of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988.\nThe Government accepts this recommendation. The Government intends to give statutory\nforce to the approval criteria for clubs (amended in line with recommendations 10, 12 to 14,\n19 and 20).\n4. Part II of the Bill - the details\nIn the statement following publication of the Cullen Report Michael Howard, the Home\nSecretary, proposed that high calibre hand guns no longer remain in private ownership, and\nthat low calibre hand guns (22 rimfire hand guns) would have to be used and kept in licensed\nclubs.65\nThe clubs in which it will still be possible to\nuse .22 handguns will be subject to the most\nstringent security standards. We shall consult as a\nmatter of urgency chief constables and other\ninterested parties on the details of the standards,\nand we shall set them out clearly in guidance. In\naddition, every individual club will need to be\napproved by the chief constable of the area in\nwhich it is situated. Handguns will be able to be\nremoved from a club only for strictly limited\npurposes, which will be specified in law, and under\nthe most stringent controls.\nFew, if any, existing gun clubs will be able to\nmeet those requirements. When the powers become\nlaw, we shall therefore require any owner of a .22\nrimfire handgun to hand his gun to the police for\nsafekeeping until he is able to find a licensed club\nthat he can join. We shall then provide a period\nfor clubs to improve their security, and to be\ninspected and licensed. Some handgun clubs may\nnever be able to achieve an adequate level of\nsecurity. If so, they will have to close.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n65 HC Deb vol 282 16/10/96 c.833-834\n60\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nIn response Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, said that the Government proposal was an\nunsatisfactory compromise:66\nThe problem with the compromise on clubs\nproposed by the Secretary of State is that there will\nstill be 40,000 handguns, including many\nsemiautomatics, remaining in private ownership-\nalbeit for use in clubs. I am aware that the\nSecretary of State proposes tight new controls on\nthe gun clubs that are allowed to remain. Is he not\naware of a most compelling case made against the\nhalfway house by the British Shooting Sports\nCouncil in its evidence to the inquiry, in paragraph\n9.68 on page 121? Referring to the crucial issue of\nthe booking out of weapons, even with tighter\ncontrols, the BSSC said:\n\"no matter what system of checks and paperwork is\nmaintained in such circumstances, it would be a simple\nmatter indeed for a shooter intent in recovering his guns to\nenter a competition, provide evidence to his club secretary\nthat he had done so, recover possession of the complete gun\ntogether with ammunition for it, and perpetrate an outrage\".\nIn the light of that evidence not least, I ask the\nSecretary of State to think again about the proposal\nto allow the licensing of some gun clubs before the\nBill is published.\nIn response to a question from Alan Beith MP, Mr Howard said that he envisaged that the\ntransportation of guns from one club to another would be permitted in \"only the most limited\ncircumstances and under the most stringent controls. For instance, the transportation should\nbe effected not by the owner of the gun but by a third party specifically authorised for that\npurpose\" (c.837).\nThe Bill allows for the establishment of licensed gun clubs once a target pistol shooting club\nhas proved that it can merit the necessary criteria. Clause 13 provides that no small calibre\npistols are allowed on club premises unless the club has a licence and the holder of the\ncertificate relating to the pistol is a member of the club and the premises are specified in the\ncertificate as those where the gun is to be stored and used. Pistol clubs will therefore have\nto become licensed clubs in order to operate in future. Clause 13(3) provides that an offence\nis committed where a small calibre pistol is used or stored in contravention of the Clause,\nwith imprisonment for up to 6 months or a £5,000 fine. Clause 14 will allow the responsible\nofficer of a licensed club to store and handle members' pistols without a firearms certificate\nfor those pistols.67\nThe granting of licences is governed by Clause 15 which provides for the Secretary of State\nto grant a licence in respect of the club and club premises. A fee of £150 would be payable.\nClause 16 enables the Secretary of State to publish guidance on the criteria for licences for\nthe purposes of informing applicants. A licence may only be granted if the Secretary of State\nis satisfied that the arrangements for storing and using small calibre pistols are such that their\nstorage or use will not endanger the public safety or the peace, following consultations with\nthe chief officer of police for the area in which the premises are situated. No official detail\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n66 HC Deb vol 282 16/10/96 c.833-834 \n67 the term \"responsible officer\" is defined in Clause 12. See the note on Clause 21 on the following page \n61\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nis available at present about the criteria for licences. Clause 17 provides that the licence is\nto be granted subject to conditions for ensuring public safety and the peace, and an offence\nis committed if the conditions are not complied with. Licences are to last for 5 years, but\nwill be removable for further periods of 5 years. There is power in Clause 18(2) for the\nSecretary of State to substitute shorter or longer periods by order. The Secretary of State may\nvary the terms and conditions of a licence if he thinks fit under Clause 19 and revoke the\nlicence under Clause 20 at any time, if he thinks fit.\nA pistol register will have to be kept by a \"responsible officer\" of a licensed pistol club under\nClause 21. A \"responsible officer\" is defined in Clause 12 as the officer of the club to whom\nthe licence was granted, or who has become the responsible officer following a variation in\nthe terms of the licence. The register will contain particulars of each pistol stored at the\npremises, namely the name and address of the person authorised by the firearm certificate to\nhave the pistol in his possession; the date the pistol was first stored at the club; and the date\nand time of the return of the pistol after removal.\nThe information on a pistols register will be kept for at least 5 years, as available for\ninspection, and further particulars may be required by regulations to be made under Clause\n22 which allows the Secretary of State to prescribe requirements in relation to licensed pistol\nclubs and their operation, impose obligations in the responsible officer or persons responsible\nfor the management of a licensed pistol club and impose obligations on those authorised\nunder S.14(2) to handle members' pistols without a certificate. No further detail is available\non the regulations which may be issued under this Clause. The regulations will be subject\nto annulment by either House of Parliament under the negative resolution procedure for S.Is.\nAuthorised police officers will have the power of entry and inspection under Clause 23 to\nascertain that the legislation conditions on a licence are being complied with and Clause 24\nmakes it an offence to make a false statement for the purpose of obtaining a licence.\nFinally, in Part III of the Bill Clause 36 substitutes a new Section 15 for the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988 which makes clear that pistol clubs can no longer receive approval\nunder S.15 since they must be licensed under Part II of the Bill. The new wording for S.15\nwill also give specific statutory authorisation for the Secretary of State to publish guidance\nabout the criteria to be applied with regard to the approval of rifle clubs under S.15 thus\nfulfilling the recommendation in the Cullen Report (see above p.56-57).\n62\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nThere is no provision in the Bill for compensation to be paid for pistol clubs which may have\nto close if they cannot meet the criteria for licensing, nor are there proposals for grants to\nassist towards the cost of providing secure premises for small calibre pistols. In the\nExplanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill the business compliance cost assessment\nnotes that the Bill \"will result in increased costs for clubs which choose to become licensed\npistol clubs. The level of costs involved will depend on the extent of their existing security\narrangements and the precise requirements which will be imposed under the Bill. These costs\ncannot currently be quantified\". Government amendments were introduced to the 1988\nFirearms (Amendment) Act during the passage of the Bill to compensate owners of weapons\nwhich would be prohibited under the 1988 Act, but the Government emphasised that it could\nnot be regarded as any sort of precedent.68 \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n68 Douglas Hogg, Home Office Minister, HC Deb 17/5/88 vol 133 c.375W\n63\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nE. Compensation\nThe Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 brought high powered self-loading rifles, burst fire\nweapons and repeating short-barrelled smooth-bore guns within the prohibited category under\nS.5 of the Firearms Act 1968, which means that special authority is required from the\nSecretary of State to possess or deal with them. The question of compensation for those who\nhad lawfully held such firearms was raised early in proceedings on the Bill which became the\n1988 Act, and which, as first presented, contained no provisions to allow such payments. The\nWhite Paper, Firearms Act 1968: Proposals for Reform69 had taken a firm line on the\nquestion of compensation:\n47. The Government has also looked carefully at the question of compensation for those\npeople who now own weapons which will become prohibited. We have concluded that as a\nmatter of principle it is undesirable and unjust to require the taxpayer at large to pay for the\nremoval from the public domain of weapons which are an acknowledged threat to life.\nAlthough there will be no market for prohibited weapons in this country, authorised dealers\nwill still be able to export them abroad, and owners will be able to recover some of the value\nin this way. Where they choose not to do so, facilities will be provided for them to be handed\nin to the police in the course of the forthcoming firearms amnesty.\nOn second reading, on 21 January 1988, the Home Secretary Douglas Hurd pointed out that\n\".... On the occasions when certain products have been banned by domestic or European\nlegislation, no compensation has been paid, and it would therefore be inequitable to pay it in\nthis instance\".70 Considerable pressure during the debate on the Money Resolution resulted\nin an undertaking to look again at the question, but it was made clear during the first sitting\nof Standing Committee F on 4 February 1988, when the sittings motion was lost, that\nprogress on the relevant clauses would depend on a clear policy statement on the question of\ncompensation. At the beginning of the second sitting on 9 February 1988, Mr Hogg\nannounced the Government's agreement to the principle of a buy-in policy.71 The power to\nmake a scheme for payments in respect of prohibited weapons was provided by S.21 of the\nAct.\nDebates of the scheme were announced on 17 May 1988:72\nSir Eldon Griffiths: To ask the Secretary of\nState for the Home Department whether he will\nnow publish details of the buy-in scheme in respect\nof firearms whose prohibition is proposed in the\nFirearms (Amendment) Bill.\nMr. Douglas Hogg: The proposed \"buy-in\"\nscheme would operate for a period of three months\nfrom the date on which the relevant provisions\ncame into force. Transitional arrangements would\nbe introduced to allow continuing possession of the\nfirearms involved during that period.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n69 Cm 261, December 1987 \n70 HC Deb. 125, c.1111 \n71 SC Deb. c.36\n72 HC Deb. 133, c.375-6W\n64\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nPayments under the scheme would be made to\npersons in respect of firearms which would become\nprohibited under the Bill and which were lawfully\nheld by them on a firearm or shotgun certificate on\nor before 22 September 1987, when my right hon.\nFriend announced the Government's intentions in a\nspeech to the Association of Police Superintendents.\nCertificate holders who acquired such firearms after\nthat date because of a previous binding contract to\npurchase would also be accommodated where\nevidence of the contract could be produced. In\naddition, such holders who acquired them before\nand sold them after 22 September 1987 would be\neligible upon production of evidence of sale.\nClaimants would be required to complete a\nclaim form obtainable from a police station or rifle\nor pistol club and to surrender the qualifying\nfirearm(s). They would also have to produce the\nrelevant firearm or shotgun certificate to the issuing\npolice force, and police records would be noted\naccordingly.\nWe expect that most claims would be for self-\nloading rifles. For these, two options would be\navailable. Claimants could apply for a fixed sum\npayment of £150. This figure takes account of the\nprice which self-loading rifles of the Kalashnikov\nand equivalent models would have fetched at\nauction before my right hon. Friend's\nannouncement of 22 September 1987. \nAlternatively, for the small number of firearms of\nconsiderably higher value, claimants could provide\nevidence of the purchase price or insurance value.\nPayment under this option would be 50 per cent. of\nthe average retail value of the firearm in the\nsummer of 1987. This formula is designed to\nproduce the amount which in general an individual\nmight reasonably expect to have obtained on the\nsale of the item at auction in the summer of 1987.\nClaimants who sold self-loading rifles after 22\nSeptember 1987 would be paid the difference\nbetween the sum received from the sale and the\nsum determined by an application under whichever\nof the two options were to be exercised.\nIn respect of all other firearms which would\nbecome prohibited, payment would be available\nonly under the second option, and where\naccompanied by the relevant documentary evidence.\nAny case that could not be reasonably determined\nby the application of these arrangements would be\nconsidered at the discretion of my right hon.\nFriend the Home Secretary, or in Scotland at the\ndiscretion of my right hon. and learned Friend the\nSecretary of State for Scotland.\nWe have proposed the scheme because of the\nunique circumstances involved: namely, that\nindividuals would be prohibited from holding\nfirearms which they were previously authorised to\nhold by the issue of a firearm or shotgun certificate\nand which have lost most or all of their market\nvalue. It cannot be regarded as any sort of\nprecedent.\nS.21 of the 1988 Act came into force on 1 February 1989 and the scheme ran until 30 April\n1989. Details of the number of firearms for which compensation was paid in England and\nWales and the costs involved were provided on 5 November 1996:73\nSir Jerry Wiggin: To ask the Secretary of\nState for the Home Department how many guns\nhave been surrendered as a result of the\nprohibitions introduced by the Firearms\n(Amendment) Act 1988; how many claims for\ncompensation remain to be settled; and what was\nthe total cost of compensation paid to date.\nMiss Widdecombe: The Department received\nnearly 3,000 claims relating to around 3,600\nfirearms under the Government buy-in-scheme for\nweapons which became prohibited by virtue of the\nFirearms (Amendment) Act 1988. A total of\n£620,000 was paid in relation to those claims. The\nDepartment has considered all claims made under\nthe scheme and advised claimants of the outcome.\nOffers have been made to all claimants entitled to\nreceive compensation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n73 HC Deb. 284, c.433W \n65\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nThe EC Directive on the Control of the Acquisition and Possession of Weapons came into\nforce for Great Britain on 1 January 1993. It was implemented by the Firearms Acts 1968\n(Amendment) Regulations 199274 and prohibited the possession of disguised firearms such as\nwalking stick shotguns and guns shaped like cigarette lighters except by recognized collectors,\nmuseums and others duly authorised. On this occasion, owners could apply for an ex-gratia\npayment if they surrendered their disguised firearms to the police, and payments were to be\nbased on the market value that the firearm might reasonably have attained immediately before\nthe ban was announced.75\nIn July 1996, the Home Affairs Committee in their Report on the Possession of Hand-guns76\nsuggested that \"If hand guns were to be banned, compensation might have to be paid to\nowners who were required to surrender their firearms\".77 The Secretary of State for Scotland\nand the Home Secretary, in a joint memorandum of evidence, commented on suggestions for\nchange and particularly on the cost of compensation:78\n34. Most of the suggestions above would lead to a requirement for the disposal of guns which\nwould no longer be able to be held legally. As in 1988, following the prohibitions imposed\nby the Firearms (Amendment) Act of that year, the Government would need to consider a\nscheme for buying in or otherwise compensating the owners of these guns.\n35. The cost is hard to assess, since it would depend to a large extent on exactly what was\nbeing compensated. The estimated number of handguns of one type or another legally held\non a police firearm certificate in Great Britain is in the order of 190,000. Handguns can be\nhigh-value items-top of the range target pistols retail for up to £2,500, or more. Target pistol\nowners may also have ancillary equipment, such as bullet-making machinery, which a\nprohibition on pistols could render redundant. Firearms dealers would also be affected, in\nsome cases severely.\nLater, in October 1996, the Cullen Report also commented on the potential cost of\ncompensating owners of hand guns should their possession be prohibited:79\n9.104 The expropriation of hand guns would give rise to clams for compensation. Mr Paton\nprovided evidence as to their cost. He stated that prices for new self-loading pistols ranged\nfrom £200 to £2,000 or more, with second-hand handguns ranging from £150 to £1,500 or\nmore. The most common price range for both new and second-handguns was from £300 to\n£600. The cost of new revolvers ranged from £200 to £1,000 or more; with second-hand\nranging from £100 to £500 or more. The average range for new and second-hand revolvers\nwas between £150 and £500. By way of comparison, a single shot pistol ranged in price\nbetween £200 and £2,000 or more; and second-hand from £50 upwards. Due to the limited\nmarket for such guns it was not possible for him to estimate an average cost. It is also right\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n74 SI 1992/2823\n75 Home Office Press Notice 30.12.92\n76 1995-96 HC 393-I\n77 ibid, para. 54\n78 1995-96 HC 393-II\n79 The Public Inquiry into the Shootings at Dunblane Primary School on 13 March 1996, Cm 3386\n66\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/102\nto take account of the money invested in accessories such as optical sights, holsters, carrying\nboxes and security cabinets. In his submission Mr Colin Greenwood stated that in Great\nBritain the annual sales of ammunition and related accessories approached £20 m: and that a\nconsiderable number of jobs - such as in clubs, manufacturing and supplying, the gun trade\nand the work of gunsmiths - were dependent on pistol shooting.\nThe Home Secretary's statement of 16 October 1996 on measures which could lead to the\ndestruction of 160,000 hand guns - \"80 per cent of those legally held today\" included the\nundertaking that appropriate compensation would be paid for hand guns legally possessed.80\nUnder clause 10 of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill 1996-97, the Secretary of State may\nmake arrangements for \"the orderly surrender at designated police stations\" of firearms the\npossession of which will become illegal, and clause 11 provides for a scheme of payments\nto individuals in respect of prohibited small firearms surrendered:\n11. The Secretary of State shall, in accordance with a scheme made by\nhim, make payments to persons who surrender firearms to a chief officer\nof police-\n(a) which they had, and were entitled to have in their possession on or\nbefore ]6th October 1996 by virtue of firearm certificates held by\nthem or by virtue of their being registered firearms dealers; or\n(b) which on or before that date they had contracted to acquire and\nwere entitled to have in their possession on and after that date by\nvirtue of such certificates held by them or by virtue of their being\nregistered firearms dealers,\nand their possession of which will become, or has become, unlawful by\nvirtue of section 1 above.\nThe Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill states that the effect on public expenditure of the\ntighter controls on firearms and the prohibition of higher calibre hand guns will depend on\nthe amount of compensation which has to be paid:\nFinancial effects of the Bill\nThe proposals in the Bill provide tighter controls on firearms and\nprohibit higher calibre handguns. Their effect on public expenditure will\ndepend largely upon the total amount of compensation that is paid out to\nfirearm owners and registered dealers. All costs are given at current prices.\nIt is expected that compensation at market value will need to be paid on\nsome 160,000 guns held by individuals and dealers which will become\nprohibited weapons.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n80 HC Deb. 282, c.833\n67\n\n\nIt is estimated that the total amount of compensation to be paid could\nrange between £25 million and £50 million.\nIn addition, there will be administrative costs for storing guns while\nthey are valued, and for handling compensation claims. It is estimated that\nthese will be between £3 million and £5 million.\nCompensation payments are likely to start in April 1997. The bulk of\nthe administrative costs will fall in the financial year 1997/98. Some\nfunding would be necessary in 1996197 to set up the compensation scheme.\nThis would be absorbed within the Home Office Vote.\nThe Home Secretary's statement of 16 October did not, however, suggest that any\ncompensation would be payable to gun clubs unable to comply with new requirements:81\nFew, if any, existing gun clubs will be able to meet\nthose requirements. When the powers become law, we\nshall therefore require any owner of a .22 rimfire handgun\nto hand his gun to the police for safekeeping until he is\nable to find a licensed club that he can join. We shall\nthen provide a period for clubs to improve their security,\nand to be inspected and licensed. Some handgun clubs\nmay never be able to achieve an adequate level of\nsecurity. If so, they will have to close.\nIt remains to be seen whether and to what extent the Sports Council will be able to make\nNational Lottery funding available in these circumstances. The Bill's business compliance\ncost assessment states that the level of costs involved for clubs which choose to become\nlicensed pistol clubs will depend on existing security arrangements and how far they can\ncomply with new requirements: \"These costs cannot currently be quantified\". \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights\nArticle 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights provides that:\nEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his\npossessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public\ninterest and subject to the conditions provided by law and by the general\nprinciples of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of\na State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of\nproperty in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of\ntaxes or other contibutions or penalties. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n81 HC Deb. 282, c.833 \n68\n\n\nThis article is frequently invoked in proceedings brought under the European Convention, but\nthe European Court of Human Rights rarely finds that a violation has taken place. This is not,\nperhaps, surprising in view of the wide range of permissible restrictions set out in the article.\nLuke Clements has suggested that:82\nWhilst the first paragraph [of article 1] delimits the situations in which\ndeprivation of possessions is permitted, the second paragraph almost\namounts to a presumption that some form of control over the enjoyment of\npossessions is inevitable.\nJ.E.S Fawcett has noted that:83\nWhat is surprising is that the Article does not clearly enunciate a right to\ncompensation for the taking of property, a principle which, though\nsometimes honoured in the breach, is recognized in the greater part of the\nworld, including those countries that seek to apply Communist doctrines of\nproperty ownership. It is left to extract, if it is possible, a right to\ncompensation out of the words 'no one shall be deprived of his possessions';\nbut the preparatory work is not helpful here.\nThe issue of the relationship between measures to control firearms and the Bill of Rights 1689\nis considered elsewhere in this Paper.\nAmnesties\nSince the beginning of controls on firearms in 1920, there have been nine amnesties: in 1933,\n1935, 1937, 1946, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1988 and 1996. The authority for the 1988 amnesty was\nexplained by Mr Douglas Hogg on 19 December 1988, and this is a typical arrangement:84\nMr. William Ross: To ask the Secretary of\nState for the Home Department under what powers\nhe acted in offering the recent firearms amnesty.\n Mr. Douglas Hogg: The amnesty had no\nstatutory basis. It amounted to an agreement by\nchief officers of police, with the consent of my\nright hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General,\nnot to bring criminal proceedings for unlawful\npossession against those who surrendered illegally\nheld firearms to the police during the period of the\namnesty.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n82 European Human Rights: Taking a Case under the Convention - Luke Clements 1994 p201\n83 The Application of the European Convention on Human Rights - J.E.S Fawcett 1987 p405-6. The interpretation\nof Article 1 by the European Court is discussed in this book (p405-411) in Luke Clements' book set out above\n(p201-205) and in Francis G. Jacobs and Robin C.A White's book The European Convention on Human Rights\n(2nd edition p246-259) amongst others\n84 HC Deb vol 144, c.138W\n69\n\n\nThe Consultation Paper of 1973 indicated that previous amnesties had been conducted on the\nsame basis, and warned against the dangers of too frequent amnesties:85\n124. This Green Paper has set out the Government's proposals for\ntightening the law on firearms. Legislation is not, however, the only means\nby which the availability of firearms to criminals can be reduced. On seven\noccasions since 1933 there have been firearms amnesties (that is, appeals for\nthe surrender of firearms coupled with assurances that those surrendering\nthem would not be prosecuted for possessing them without a certificate). An\namnesty provides those in illegal possession of firearms with an opportunity\nto dispose of them without fear of prosecution, so reducing the number of\nillegally held firearms in circulation. The practice has been for the Home\nSecretary to consult chief officers of police about the desirability of an\namnesty, and then to ask them not to prosecute for illegal possession persons\nhanding in firearms during the amnesty. Corresponding action is taken in\nScotland. The last amnesty was held in 1968. immediately before the\nprovisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 about shot gun certificates came\ninto operation; over one-third of the firearms handed in then were unwanted\nshot guns.\n125. The figures of firearms handed in during previous amnesties\nsuggest that there are considerable numbers of illegally held firearms which\nwill be handed in when their possessors are given the opportunity to do this\nwithout fear of prosecution. If amnesties were too frequent, the impression\nmight be given that the illegal possession of firearms was not a serious\noffence, and those holding firearms without certificates might be encouraged\nto retain them in the belief that there would always be an opportunity to\nhand them in next time there was an amnesty.\nThe last amnesty ran from 3 to 30 June 1996 and on 23 July 1996 the Home Secretary\nannounced in a written answer that nearly 23,000 firearms, 700,000 rounds of ammunition and\n3,000 other weapons were surrendered to police forces in Great Britain.86 A Home Office\npress notice of the same date revealed that the final figures for different types of weapons\nwere:\nRifles 1,859\nSmooth-bore guns 8,649\nHand guns 4,442\nOther firearms 7,989\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n85 Cmnd 5297, 1973\n86 HC Deb 282, c.172W\n70\n\n\nThe 1988 amnesty lasted for the month of September 1988, and its promotion was to cost\n£500,000.87 A total of 42,725 firearms and 1,511,000 rounds of ammunition were surrendered\nin England and Wales.88 This was considered to compare most favourably with the 1968\nappeal which extended over three months when 25,088 firearms and 795,163 rounds of\nammunition were handed in. Notes to the press notice includes the fact that the substantial\nmajority of guns surrendered were of military origin, dating back to the Great War or World\nWar II. This had produced a high proportion of pistols and revolvers in the total and there\nwas a decline in the proportion of shotguns compared with 1968. In Scotland, 5,177 firearms\nand 221,703 rounds of ammunition were surrendered in 1988 (ibid).\nWeapons surrendered under ammesties are destroyed, except for those of historical\nsignificance which were acquired by museums under special arrangements. None is offered\nfor sale.89\nOn 15 May 1996 Alex Carlile MP asked the Home Secretary what procedures other than a\nnational amnesty exist for members of the public to dispose of firearms that have been owned\nor discovered without a licence. The answer read as follows:90\nWhether to prosecute offences of unlawful possession\nof firearms is a matter for the prosecuting authorities on a\ncase by case basis. But Home Office guidance to the\npolice is that no obstacle should be placed in the way of\nindividuals who wish to hand in unlicensed or unwanted\nguns, even when an amnesty is not running. Our current\nguidance, publicly available from Her Majesty's Stationery\nOffice since 1989 in \"Firearms Law: Guidance to the\npolice\", underlines this advice.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n87 Home Office Press Notice, 31.8.88\n88 24.1.1989; HC Deb. 145, cc.508-514W and Home Office Press Notice, 3.11.88\n89 15.5.96 HC Deb. 277 c.455W\n90 HC Deb. 477, c.455W\n71\n\n\nF. Firearms control and the Bill of Rights 1689\nFrom time to time there have been assertions that the Bill of Rights 168991 may affect\nstatutory attempts at gun control, as contemplated in the present bill.92 This Section seeks\nto explore, in general terms, some of the relevant constitutional issues. The detailed law of\npossession of firearms is dealt with elsewhere in this paper.\nArticle 7\nWhat is commonly described as article 7 of the Bill of Rights is as follows:\n\"Subject's arms -- That the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their\ndefence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law\"\nSchwoerer has neatly summarised the background and legislative history of this provision.93\nIn particular, she noted that the two qualifiers -- \"suitable to their conditions\" and \"as allowed\nby law\" -- were amendments introduced by the House of Lords: \"their effect was to limit the\nright to bear arms to the Protestant upper classes, according to the laws already passed,\" and\nshe concluded that \"in its final form, with the qualifying clauses, the article both reaffirmed\nancient laws in giving men the right to possess arms according to their social and economic\nstanding and declared new law in limiting the right to Protestants.\"94\nBlackstone referred to the article in the general context of civil liberties in English law:95\n5. The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I at present\nmention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition\nand degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the\nsame statute 1 W. & M. st. 2, c. 2, and it is indeed a public allowance under\ndue restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when\nthe sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the\nviolence of oppression.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n91 Sometimes dated 1688. There is a similar provision, although not in the positive terms of the English provision,\nin the Scottish Claim of Right 1689: Stair Encyclopaedia, vol 10 para 1502. Doubt has been expressed as to the\napplication of the Bill of Rights to Northern Ireland; see G Lock, \"The 1689 Bill of Rights\", (1989) XXXVII\nPolitical Studies 540, 557-8. The application of international law, such as the European Convention on Human\nRights, is not considered here (on which see, for example, Baroness Chalker's written answer, HL Deb vol 571\nc.WA1, 1.4.96) \n92 For example, Mr Richard Munday, who submitted evidence to the Cullen Tribunal and the recent Home Affairs\nCommittee inquiry on hand guns, has analysed the relevant provisions in their historical and contemporary context.\nThis has apparently formed the basis of some of the arguments currently being put to Ministers and Members \n93 L Schwoerer, The declaration of rights 1689, 1981, pp74-8\n94 p.78\n95 W Blackstone, Commentaries, 21st ed, 1844 (by J Hargrave), pp143-4\n72\n\n\n  In these several articles consist the rights, or, as they are frequently termed,\nthe liberties of Englishmen: liberties, more generally talked of than\nthoroughly understood; and yet highly necessary to be perfectly known and\nconsidered by every man of rank or property, lest his ignorance of the points\nwhereon they are founded should hurry him into faction and licentiousness\non the one hand, or a pusillanimous indifference and criminal submission on\nthe other. And we have seen that these rights consist, primarily, in the free\nenjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private property.\nSo long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly free; for every\nspecies of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act in opposition to one\nor other of these rights, having no other object upon which it can possibly\nbe employed. To preserve these from violation, it is necessary that the\nconstitution of parliament be supported its full vigour; and limits, certainly\nknown, be set to the royal prerogative. And lastly, to vindicate these rights,\nwhen actually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in\nthe first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the\ncourts of law; next, to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for\nredress of grievances; and, lastly, to the right of having and using arms for\nself-preservation and defence. And all these rights and liberties it is our\nbirthright to enjoy entire; unless where the laws of our country have laid\nthem under necessary restraints-restraints in themselves so gentle and\nmoderate, as will appear upon farther inquiry, that no man of sense or\nprobity would wish to see them slackened. For all of us have it in our\nchoice to do everything that a good man would desire to do; and are\nrestrained from nothing, but what would be pernicious either to ourselves or\nour fellow-citizens.\nThe 1689 article has been cited inside and outwith Parliament at various times. For example,\nduring debates on what became the Seizure of Arms Act 181996, it was considered in some\ndetail. A protest against the bill in the Lords Journal cited both article 7 and Blackstone in\ndefence of British subjects' rights to bear arms for their defence.97 During the Commons\ncommittee stage, Canning, for the government, accepted the relevance of article 7, but\nemphasised the qualifications in the provision:98\nIt was most true, as had been laid down, that\nall subjects were entitled by the Bill of Rights to\nhave arms, but with one small qualification, which\nhe mentioned not in praise of, or with a view to\nestablish the qualifications, but as showing that at\nthe very time when our ancestors laid down the\nprinciple they contemplated the exception. Those\nwho had cited the Bill of Rights had uniformly\nomitted the important words- \"All subjects being\nProtestants have a right so to be armed.\" How had\nit happened that in all the discussions for the last\nthree weeks, in all the public addresses for the last\nthree months, that clause had been carefully\nexcluded? What was to be inferred from those\nwords? - That the Papists ought now to be\ndisarmed? Certainly not: he only brought them\nforward to illustrate the position, that this general\nright, like every other, was subject to qualification;\nand nothing could more satisfactorily prove its\nsubjectness to qualification than the fact, that at the\nvery moment the right was conferred it was actually\nqualified. Though the current of opinion was at\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n96 Some sources cite this as 1820\n97 Parl Deb vol 41 c754, 6.12.1819 (HL)\n98 cc. 1142-3, 14.12.1819\n73\n\n\npresent against such an exception of the Catholics\nhe was not sure whether, by any subsequent law, it\nhad been repealed; but supposing it remained on\nthe Statute-book, that clause would exclude from\nthe possession of arms no small portion of the\ninhabitants in some of the disturbed districts.\nWould he then exempt the professors of the\nCatholic religion from the right of having arms for\nself-defence? No; he had always argued in a\ncontrary direction; but the Bill of Rights, correctly\nquoted and properly construed, brought him to the\nprovision of the bill on the table, which, in fact,\nrecognised the general right of the subject to have\narms, but qualified that right in such a manner as\nthe necessity of the case required. As the Papists\nat the Revolution, were armed against the existing\ngovernment, and were excepted in the Bill of\nRights, so the act before the House excepted the\ndisaffected in the disturbed districts who were in\narms against the law and authorities of the land. \nHe appealed, therefore, to the Bill of Rights in\ndefence of the step he now called upon the House\nto take; and he contended that it would only be to\ncarry into effect the very doctrines our forefathers\nhad shown that they admitted. In the spirit of the\nBill of Rights, he called upon the legislature to\ninterpose to suspend a right, and take away arms\nthat could not be held without danger to the\ntranquillity of the state. \nGreenwood's 1972 study, Firearms control, analysed the application of the 1689 provision as\npart of a general history of firearms regulation.99 He noted that \"the bill did not seek to\ndisarm Catholics, but merely to ensure that discrimination against Protestants in the matter\nof keeping arms for their defence should cease\", and considered the legal context of the\nprovision: \"As with most of the great constitutional milestones, the Bill of Rights must be\ncarefully considered against the conditions of the times.\"100 He cited the extract from\nBlackstone, and concluded:101\nBlackstone's Commentaries were then, and indeed still are, regarded as the\ndefinitive statement of the Common Law. In matters relating to Common\nLaw they are still quoted with authority in the highest courts. His study of\nthe Common Law and the Constitution as it relates to the right to have arms\nmust, therefore, be accepted as indeed it was by later English governments-\nas an accurate assessment of the state of the law at the time of writing. The\nright to keep arms appears to have persisted until the twentieth century and\nthe effect of the Constitution on twentieth-century laws and practice is a\nmatter for discussion under that heading. Certainly the right was jealously\npreserved by parliament during the nineteenth century.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n99 C Greenwood, Firearms control: a study of armed crime and firearms control in England and Wales, 1972, pp11-\n5. The author is a firearms consultant and was a special adviser to the Home Affairs Committee in its recent\ninquiry on the possession of handguns: see his memorandum (esp paras 1-9), 5th report, vol II, HC 393-II, 1995-\n96, pp107ff\n100 p.11\n101 pp13-4\n74\n\n\nIn his evidence to the Home Affairs Committee, he summarised his argument in the following\nterms:102\n12. Early English legislation relating to firearms was concerned only with the duty of the\ncitizen to arm himself for the defence of the realm and for the maintenance of order. Early\nlegislation restricting the use of it was concerned only with the maintenance of compulsory\npractice with the longbow or with the preservation of game. There was a clear and recognised\nright, as well as a duty for the subject to have arms for his own protection and to discharge\nhis duty to the state, though those arms would not necessarily have been firearms.\n13. The Bill of Rights of 1688 made it perfectly clear that Parliament considered that\nthere was a right for citizens to have arms (page 11) and by the mid 18th century the Common\nLaw was very clear in recognising a Constitutional right to have arms which Parliament had\nno authority to breach in general terms (page 12). In the early 19th century, perceived dangers\nof major disorder resulted in the \"Six Acts\" amongst which was the Seizure of Arms Act 1820\nwhich appeared to abrogate the right to keep arms. Debates in Parliament (pages 14 and 15)\nmade it clear that the Government accepted that there was indeed a right to keep arms but\ntheir view was that the Constitution allowed for qualification of that right for a limited period\nand in specified area. The Seizure of Arms Act automatically lapsed after two years and was\napplied only to specified areas of the country. Until the start of the 20th century, therefore,\nthe right to keep arms was vigorously upheld by Parliament and all attempts at legislation to\nrestrict arms generally or firearms in particular failed completely.\nIn R v Dewhurst (1820) 1St Tr NS 529 (a criminal case of unlawful assembly etc), Bayley\nJ, summing up, said, inter alia:103 \nOn the subject of carrying arms the learned\njudge said: Gentlemen, I forgot to observe to you\non the subject of carrying arms that I do not agree\nwith the counsel on the part of the defendants that\npersons have a right to carry arms in the way in\nwhich those arms are described to have been\ncarried. Mr. Justice Blackstone lays down the right\nof the subject to carry arms as\n\"having arms for their defence, suitable to their\ncondition and degree, and such as are allowed by\nlaw. Which is also declared by the same statute 1\nWilliam and Mary, sess. 2. c.2; and it is indeed a\npublic allowance under due restrictions of the\nnatural right of resistance and self-preservation,\nwhen the sanctions of society and laws are found\ninsufficient to restrain the violence of\noppression.\"(a)\nGentlemen, he refers to the Bill of Rights.\nYou will see what the Bill of Rights says upon that\nsubject. It provides that,\n\"The subjects which are Protestants may have arms\nfor their defence suitable to their conditions, and as\nallowed by law.\"(b)\nBut are arms suitable to the condition of people\nin the ordinary class of life, and are they allowed\nby law? A man has a clear right to arms to protect\nhimself when he is going singly or in a small party\nupon the road where he is travelling or going for\nthe ordinary purposes of business, But I have no\ndifficulty in saying you have no right to carry arms\nto a public meeting, if the number of arms which\nare so carried are calculated to produce terror and\nalarm; and if you could be at liberty to carry arms\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n102 op cit, p108. A memorandum by Mr Michael Yardley makes a similar claim for the 1689 provision: \"The Bill\nof Rights of 1689 confirmed a constitutional right to keep and bear arms .... The interesting point is that the right\nto keep arms without impediment -- which was enshrined in common law until the late Victorian era -- is not a\nColonial invention\" (p143). The last point is a reference to the \"right to bear arms\" provision of the Second\nAmendment to the US Constitution \n103 601-2. See also, for example, R v Smith [1914] II IR 190, and cases cited therein\n75\n\n\nupon an expectation that by possibility there might\nbe an attack at the place, that would be an excuse\nfor carrying arms in every instance when you went\nto a public meeting.(a) Therefore, I have no\ndifficulty in saying persons are not warranted in\ncarrying arms to a public meeting, if they are\ncalculated to create terror and alarm. You have no\nright to suspect there will be an illegal attack on\nyou. Therefore, you are not at liberty to carry arms\nwith you.\nArticle 12\nIt has also been suggested that the Bill of Rights is relevant to any scheme of surrender of\nfirearms, including compensation arrangements, as in clauses 10 and 11 of the current bill.\nThe relevant provision which proponents of this argument may have in mind may be article\n12:\n\"Grants of forfeitures -- That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of\nparticular persons before conviction are illegal and void.\"\nLock has described the historical context of this provision:104\nThis Article related to a system which worked as follows: if somebody was being tried for\ntreason (for example), it was the law that his possessions would be forfeit to the Crown if he\nwere convicted. Courtiers, or other well-placed individuals, would secure a promise from the\nCrown that, in the event of a conviction, they would be given the traitor's property.\nHalsbury's Laws sets out the general position of the right to property in English law:105\n833. Right to property. The right not to be deprived of property without due\nprocess of law(1) originated in Magna Carta(2) and has been restated and\namplified subsequently.(3) The right does not exclude expropriation for\npublic purposes such as by nationalisation or compulsory purchase order(4),\nbut an intention on the part of the legislature to deprive a person of his\nproperty without compensation is not to be imputed unless it is stated in\nexpress terms.(5) The right to property is protected by remedies in equity\nand tort. The right includes a right to peaceful enjoyment of property(6),\nwhich is similarly protected, but is subjected to compliance with legal\nrequirements as to user(7) and avoidance of injury to others and their\nproperty.(8)\nThe right may be regarded as embracing the principle of no taxation\nwithout representation(9); this principle, however, in view of the application\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n104 op cit p.560 fn 102\n105 vol 8, para 833.

This is considered further below.\nThe 'constitutional' status of the Bill of Rights 1689\nWhile, in the unwritten/uncodified UK constitution, there are no unambiguously constitutional\n'higher' laws as such107, statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689108 are generally regarded as\nbeing 'core' constitutional laws which deserve and receive particular respect and scrutiny by\nthe three branches of government. For example it is argued that legislators should take care\nwhen passing laws which do or could conflict with such 'constitutional' provisions, and the\ncourts will generally be unwilling to accept that the provisions of such legislation has been\noverridden by later statutes except in clear language. See, for example, Lord Wilberforce,\nextra-judicially:109\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n106 E.g. A-G v De Keyser's Royal Hotel [1920] AC 508, HL; Burmah Oil v LA 1964 SC (HL) 117, [1965] AC 75\n107 On which see Research Paper 96/82, 18.7.96, The constitution: principles and development, esp chaps III, V\nand VI\n108 or the Union legislation of 1707 and 1800, the Parliaments Acts 1911 and 1949 and the European Communities\nAct 1972 for example\n109 Privileges Committee, report on the petition of the Irish peers, HL 53, 1966-67, p73. See also Re Parliamentary\nPrivilege Act 1770 [1958] 2 All ER 329, PC, esp Viscount Simonds at 333: \"The conclusion that this privilege,\nsolemnly reasserted in the Bill of Rights, was within a few years abrogated or at least vitally impaired cannot\n77\n\n\nIn strict law there may be no difference in status... as between one Act of Parliament and\nanother, but I confess to some reluctance in holding that an Act of such constitutional\nsignificance as the Union with Ireland Act is subject to the doctrine of implied repeal or of\nobsolescence.\nThis has not prevented later express or implied repeal or amendment of supposed\n'untouchable' constitutional statutory provisions, such as that in the Bill of Rights itself\nconcerning the succession to the throne, declared to be a provision which \"shall stand remain\nand be the law of this realm for ever..\", which was altered a dozen years later by the Act of\nSettlement 1700.\nIn the civil liberties context Feldman has related the provisions of the Bill of Rights to modern\ncircumstances:\nOver time, others have benefited from the ethos of government produced by\nMagna Carta and the Bill of Rights. However, to say that they offer\neffective protection to rights ignores the reality of modern and perhaps pre-\nmodern, legislation and administration. The doctrine of parliamentary\nsupremacy, which Dicey advanced as a way of ensuring continuing\ndemocratic accountability for legislation, left Parliament with the more or\nless untrammelled power to restrict or abrogate rights and freedoms, as well\nprotect them. Magna Carta and the 1689 Bill of Rights can be repealed or\namended by implication by statutes, without even the need for express\nwords. Except in relation to the protection of property against unauthorized\ntaxation(94), the Bill of Rights has been restrictively interpreted, for example\ndenying a remedy to prisoners under the clause forbidding cruel and unusual\npunishment unless the punishment could be shown to be both cruel and\nunusual.(95)\n94 Congreve v. Home Office [1976] QB 629\n95 Williams v. Home Office (No.2) [1981] 1 All ER 1211, below, ch. 6, s. 3(4)\nNevertheless the Bill of Rights remains an operative statute, as the history of the\nParliamentary privilege of free speech demonstrates.110 In Bowles v Bank of England [1913]\n1 Ch 57 at 84-5, (no taxation other than by Act of Parliament, ie not by prerogative or\nresolution of a House of Parliament), Parker J said that \"the Bill of Rights still remains\nunrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the\npart of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its\nprovisions.\"111 Some of the articles are more 'loosely' phrased than others, a factor in their\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \nlightly be reached\"\n110 See Research Paper 96/61, 16.5.96, Defamation Bill [HL], Bill 127 of 1995-96: Parliamentary privilege.

This is made clear in the Commons Journal:\nAnd towards the making a more firm and perfect Settlement of the said Religion, Laws and Liberties;\nand for Remedy of several Defects and Inconveniences; it is proposed and advised by the said\nCommons, that there be Provision, by new Laws, made in such manner, and with such Limitations,\nas, by the wisdom and Justice of Parliament, shall be considered and ordained in the Particulars, and\nto the Purposes, following...\nAt this point in the Journal a list is given of the headings to be covered by the programme.\nThe Declaration of Rights was drawn up in a hurry and was confined to topics on which the\nCommons and Lords could agree. The original draft produced by the Commons' Committee\nincluded 28 heads but of these only 11 were included among the 13 appearing in the final\nversion. The remainder had to be sacrificed in the interests of speed and compromise. The\nidea of dealing with new rights, as opposed to stating existing rights, had to go by the board\nso that, for example, the granting of security of tenure to the higher judiciary had to be left\nfor a later occasion.\nHe believed that \"whatever William's intentions may have been, [i.e. in the situation which\narose in 1689] the basic text of the Articles has been regarded as having statutory force, but\nthere can be a difficulty in the application to modern conditions of provisions enacted in very\nbrief terms three centuries ago.\"114\nIf the question of the application of the provision in the Bill of Rights to proposed or actual\nmeasures of firearms control ever arose before the courts, doubtless the answer could hinge,\nto some extent, on the construction of the qualifying phrases in article 7 \"for their defence\",\n\"suitable to their conditions\" and \"as allowed by law\"; the applicability, if any, of the prima\nfacie religious discrimination provision in modern circumstances,115 and the historical-legal\ncontext of the relevant legislation and caselaw, such as the existence, if at all, of some legal\n'right' to possess firearms in light of the regulatory legislation of this century. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n112 It may be noted that Wade & Bradley's standard constitutional law text cites every article -- \"principal provisions\n(known as 'articles'), many of which are still in force as part of English law\" -- except article 7: Constitutional\nand administrative law, 11th ed (by Bradley and Ewing), 1993 , pp14-5. Lock lists article 7 as one of those\ndealing with \"issues that are no longer a problem\", op cit, p560\n113 Lock, op cit, pp541-2\n114 p.542\n115 For example, would it be regarded in the same light as the religious (dis)qualifications for the succession?\n79\n\n\nG. Northern Ireland\nFirearm control in Northern Ireland is governed by the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order\n1981, as amended.116 A review of the legislation announced on 23.11.95 is in progress to take\naccount of developments in firearms technology and design and the growth in recreational and\nsporting use of firearms in the consideration of legislation \"largely unchanged since the\n1960's\".\nControls in Northern Ireland are broadly similar to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\nOn 1 November 1996, Sir John Wheeler announced a PQ on the law on hand guns in\nNorthern Ireland:117\nMr. Worthington: To ask the Secretary of State\nfor Northern Ireland if he will list the difference in\nrespect of guidelines relating to the legal possession\nof handguns in (a) Northern Ireland and (b) Great\nBritain.\nSir John Wheeler: Under the Firearms (Northern\nIreland) Order, 1981, the Chief Constable is\nresponsible for the administration of firearms\nlicensing. His policy in relation to sporting\nhandguns which was agreed with the Secretary of\nState is that a person cannot acquire a handgun\nunless he is able to show good reason for acquiring\nsuch a firearm and he has been a member of a\nregistered firearms club for a minimum of 12\nmonths; the application is supported by the\nsecretary of the firearms club; and the police are\ncontent that he is a suitable person to hold such a\nweapon. In addition, the Chief Constable may\napprove the issue of a handgun where a person's\nlife is believed to be under a serious and specific\nterrorist threat. In these circumstances the Chief\nConstable must satisfy himself that the individual is\nin all regards suitable to hold such a firearm and\nthat his possession of the firearm does not pose a\nthreat to the wider public safety.\nThe main difference is perhaps that the stricter controls in Great Britain over rifles, pistols\nand short-barrelled shotguns etc. are applied in Northern Ireland to shotguns and air weapons.\nIn particular the onus is on the applicant to show that s/he has good reason to possess a\nfirearm, rather than on the police to show that s/he does not . The distinction has developed\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n116 SI 1981/155\n117 HC Deb 284, c.281W\n80\n\n\nRecent Research Papers on related subjects include:\n \n96/99 The Crime (Sentences) Bill [Bill 3 of 1996-97] 01.11.96 \n96/100 The Crime (Sentences) Bill and the Crime and 31.10.96\nPunishment (Scotland) Bill: provisions for mentally\ndisordered offenders\n96/15 Controls on Knives and other Offensive Weapons 25.01.96\n95/29 Investigating and reviewing possible miscarriages of 03.03.95\njustice - The Criminal Appeal Bill [Bill 57 of 1994/95] \n\n\n\n"],"description_s":["Controls on firearms: the Firearms (Amendment) Bill (Bill 10 1996/97).

Landfill is by far the most common means of waste disposal in the UK, but the\nGovernment's recent sustainable waste management strategy Making Waste Work undertook\nto reduce the amount of waste being disposed of in this way.

For so-called 'controlled' wastes,\nthe same figures are over 70% landfilled and 20% reused or recycled. Controls on landfill\npractice are tighter today than in the past but environmental problems can still arise,\nparticularly in the generation of gas from landfill sites. In its sustainable development and\nwaste management strategies the Government has undertaken to swing the balance away from\nlandfill in favour of reuse, recycling and energy recovery from waste. The amount of waste\ngoing to incineration, with energy recovery, is set to rise for various reasons, and energy from\nlandfill gas has also been included in the Non Fossil Fuel Obligations. The packaging waste\nstream should start to decline as a result of the EU Packaging Directive which will soon be\nimplemented in the UK. \nOn 1 October 1996 a new tax on waste disposal in landfill sites came into effect, following\na two year consultation process. The tax is levied per tonne of waste at two rates: £2 per\ntonne for specified inactive wastes (such as glass); £7 per tonne for active wastes which are\ncapable of degrading (such as paper). Around 1,400 businesses will pay the tax, though\nlandfill site operators can mitigate its effects by contributing to an environmental trust. The\ntax is expected to raise about £450 million per year, and the Government proposes to use\nthese receipts to help fund a cut in the main rate of National Insurance Contributions for\nemployers (from 10.2% to 10% from 6 April 1997).\nThe decision to impose a landfill tax and for this to be weight-based has been welcomed by\nenvironmental organisations, although some have called for the levy to be set at a far higher\nrate, and to cover all aspects of waste disposal, including incineration. Nevertheless, the\ngeneral view is that the advantages of landfill over incineration are set to decline anyway and\nthat while the levy will not have a significant effect on the amount of waste going to landfill\nin the short term, it may in the longer term. Similarly, although even a higher levy would\nprobably do little to encourage recycling at present, again in the longer term this might\nchange. A system of environmental trusts has been established to fund research into\nrestoration of landfill sites, and clean-ups where liability is unclear. There have been fears\nthat the levy may cause an increase in the illegal dumping of waste, or fly-tipping, and also\nthat it may place burdens on local authority budgets; such issues are discussed in this paper. \nThe UK is not alone in introducing a landfill levy, nor in relying heavily on landfill as a\ndisposal route. The EU's proposed Landfill Directive has just been rejected by the European\nParliament, and the Commission is about to table new proposals. In general, other Member\nStates favour tighter controls on landfill than the UK, and are seeking pretreatment of wastes\ngoing to landfill, and restrictions on co-disposal sites (where different types of waste are\nlandfilled together). The UK's geology favours landfill to a greater extent than other countries,\nand we have long experience of operating co-disposal sites; the Government has undertaken\nto oppose any moves to require pretreatment for all wastes going to landfill.\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nII Landfill\nA. Waste management strategy in the UK\n1. The shifting scene\nLandfill has long been the mainstay of British waste management practice and far outstrips\nany other disposal method. For example, in the UK 90% of household waste is sent to\nlandfill, with only 5% of household waste being recycled and another 5% being incinerated.\nThe Government's recent sustainable waste management strategy Making Waste Work1\nmentions that \"landfill has served mankind for much longer than any alternative disposal\noption.\" \nIn the UK this is largely because our geology is more favourable towards landfill than that,\nfor instance, of other European countries. Generally, a clay rather than fissured or permeable\nbedrock means that less money needs to be spent on engineering a landfill site, because there\nis less danger of water carrying pollutants downwards or of liquid pollutants escaping and\nseeping into water resources including valuable groundwaters or surface waters.2 So landfill\nhas been a cheap waste disposal option in the UK. Since waste disposal is carried out largely\nby the private sector, such factors have favoured the continued use of landfill in the UK. Yet\nin Making Waste Work3 the Government states that its primary waste management targets are\nto:4\n• reduce the proportion of controlled waste going to landfill from 70%\nto 60% by 2005\n• recover [includes incinerating] value from 40% of municipal waste by\n2005\n• set a target for the reduction of waste by the end of 1998.\nThis is because while over the years the engineering standards of landfill practice have\nincreased markedly it can still be argued that the full environmental costs of landfilling waste\nare not reflected in the relatively cheap price of landfill as a disposal option. In the first of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Department of the Environment (DoE)/Welsh Office, Making waste work: a strategy for sustainable waste\nmanagement in England and Wales, Cm 3040 December 1995 p.62\n2 DoE, UK National Environmental Health Action Plan, Cm 3323 July 1996\n3 Cm 3040 December 1995 pp 8-9\n4 Secondary targets include easily accessible recycling facilities for 80% of households by the year 2000; local\nauthorities have been set a target of recycling 25% of household waste by the year 2000.\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nits This Common Inheritance series of White Papers on the environment, the Government\nundertook to apply the 'precautionary principle' to environmental policy:5\n\"Where there are significant risks of damage to the environment, the Government will\nbe prepared to take precautionary action to limit the use of potentially dangerous\nmaterials, or the spread of potentially dangerous pollutants, even where scientific\nknowledge is not conclusive, if the balance of likely costs and benefits justifies it.\"\nThe discrepancy between the environmental costs and the price of landfill becomes more\nmarked when the principles of sustainable development are applied. Sustainable development\nentails conserving scarce resources, and minimising damage to the environment6. Void space\nfor landfill is a finite resource, and while technical standards of landfill sites have improved,\nthere is still always the possibility of environmental damage occurring (see page 11 onwards).\nThe Government Panel on Sustainable Development in its second report7 continued to\nadvocate a move towards the use of taxes on resources including energy rather than labour\nand income, and welcomed the (then proposed) landfill tax. In its 1994 sustainable\ndevelopment strategy produced in the wake of the Rio Earth Summit the Government\nhighlighted the unsustainability of current waste management practices:8\n\"Large quantities of waste arise as an undesirable by-product of modern production,\npackaging and consumption, with threats to soil, air and water quality if the waste is\nnot properly managed. The aim must be to minimise the amount of waste produced\nand to make best use of the waste which is produced. In this way, loss of valuable\nraw materials and the land which is required for disposal can both be minimised. \n...There is a hierarchy of waste management options:\n• REDUCTION\n• REUSE\n• RECOVERY (INCLUDING RECYCLING AND\nENERGY RECOVERY)\n• DISPOSAL WITHOUT ENERGY RECOVERY BY\nINCINERATION OR LANDFILL\nCurrent waste management practice is tilted too far towards the last option. However,\ntruly sustainable choices are complex...\"\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 DoE, This Common Inheritance - Britain's environmental strategy, Cm 1200 September 1990 p.11\n6 see Sustainable development: Agenda 21 and Earth Summit II, Library Research Paper 96/87, 16 August 1996\n7 DoE, British Government Panel on Sustainable Development Second Report, January 1996\n8 Cm 2426 January 1994 p.14\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIn 1993 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) published its seventeenth\nreport - Incineration of Waste9 - which called for an increase in incineration, noting that the\n\"emissions from a well operated incineration plant complying with the new HMIP10 standards\nare most unlikely to cause any health effects.\" The RCEP lamented the UK's reliance on\nlandfill, particularly because of its contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. Energy from\nwaste has now been included in the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligations (see page 15) but bands\ninclude both incineration and the use of landfill gas so it is difficult to tell how this will affect\nthe balance between the two practices. \nFinally, it is worth noting that the packaging waste stream should start to decline as a result\nof EC Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, which should have been\nimplemented in Member States by 30 June 1996. By 30 June 2001, 50-65% by weight of\npackaging waste will have to be recovered (recovery includes incineration for energy) and 25-\n45% will have to be recycled, with at least 15% by weight of each packaging material being\nrecycled. In the UK, a comprehensive consultation with industry has resulted in the decision\nto apply a shared legal obligation to all large businesses (which manufacture, fill, sell or\nsupply packaging, and which use over 50 tonnes of packaging a year) no matter where they\nlie in the packaging chain. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste)\nRegulations: A Consultation Paper11 was open for consultation until 9 September; the\nenvironmental agencies will police the scheme, and final implementing Regulations should\nbe laid in November 1996. \n2. The UK waste management regime\nThe UK's waste management system operates under Part II of the Environmental Protection\nAct 1990 (EPA) as amended by the Environment Act 1995. The EPA had strengthened and\nlargely superseded the waste management licensing system which had been operating under\nthe Control of Pollution Act 1974 (CoPA) and introduced the concept of 'duty of care' of\nwaste, prohibiting its unauthorised or harmful deposit, treatment or disposal. \nAnyone in control of waste must prevent the escape of the waste from their control, and must\npass the waste on only to an authorised person. In addition, anyone wishing to operate\ndisposal, storage or treatment facilities for controlled waste, whether or not destined for\nrecycling or disposal, requires a waste disposal or management licence from a waste disposal\nor regulation authority, although exempted activities exist. Breaching any conditions attached\nto such a licence is an offence. Under the EPA, the waste regulation authorities (WRAs)\nwere generally the local authorities, who were thereby able to ensure that waste disposal\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 Cm 2181 May 1993\n10 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, now part of the Environment Agency\n11 Department of the Environment 1996 dep/3 3683\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\ncompanies disposed of waste properly. The waste disposal companies were either private\nfirms to whom work was contracted out (particularly in the industrial and commercial waste\nfields) or were local authority waste disposal companies set up at arms length. \nThe Environment Act 1995 transferred waste regulation powers to the newly created\nenvironment agencies12 which are intended to provide a 'one stop shop' approach to\nenvironmental protection and regulation and incorporate the former National Rivers Authority\n(NRA) and HMIP, plus the waste regulation powers of local authorities. This should provide\na national integrated approach to pollution control. For example, consider a landfill site\noperating in England. The NRA, which used to grant consents to discharge pollution into\nwater courses, would have set licence conditions to prevent water carrying away contaminants\nfrom the landfill site. As well as this, the local authority, acting as the waste regulation\nauthority, would have issued a waste management licence for the site to be operated. The\nwaste regulation authority could also impose licence conditions to prevent landfill sites from\ncausing serious problems. Under the 1995 Act the environment agencies will issue\nenvironmental licences which will cover all environmental aspects of running a landfill site.\nOf course the duty of care concept means that the illegal dumping of waste, or fly-tipping,\nis an offence, and if any waste is deposited on land in contravention of the duty of care\nprovisions, the environment agencies may take steps necessary to remove or reduce the effect\nof the waste, if this is necessary to prevent pollution or damage to health. In addition, the\nControl of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989 and Regulations made under it allow the\nregulatory authorities (now the environment agencies) to stop and investigate a vehicle\ncarrying waste, if they have reasonable grounds to believe that it has been used for the illegal\ndisposal of waste. \n3. Wastes arising and disposal routes\n \n'Controlled waste' (the term arises because the waste is in effect 'controlled' by the provisions\nof the 1990 EPA and duty of care) includes household, industrial and commercial waste,\nsewage sludge and dredged spoils. The main exemptions from the definition of controlled\nwaste are agricultural, mine and quarry wastes, and most radioactive waste13. \nControlled waste also includes 'special waste', which is the most dangerous controlled waste\nand thus subject to extra controls. These now include the need for prior notification to the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 The Environment Agency in England and Wales and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. See\nThe Environment Bill (HL) (Bill 85 1994/95), Library Research Paper 95/50, 12 April 1995\n13 Controlled Waste Regulations SI 1992/588\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nEnvironmental Agency of all consignments, which are then registered on a national database.\nThe mixing of different categories of special waste, and of special and non-special wastes is\nprohibited. 'Special waste' is defined by Regulations which implemented EC Directive 91/689\non hazardous waste, and household waste is exempted from being special waste14. \nData on the amount of wastes produced and their management are scarce in the UK, as in\nmuch of the rest of Europe. The sole regular source of waste data for England and Wales is\nthe annual survey of former waste disposal authorities undertaken by the Chartered Institute\nof Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). In recent years, however, the response rates\nfrom authorities have been so low that its figures cannot be used to produce national\nestimates15.\nThe Department of the Environment has published details of its proposals for improving the\nquality of waste management data in future years16, but for the moment is reliant on data\nestimated from a number of surveys undertaken in 1990 and in the latter part of the 1980s.\nThese surveys suggest that over 400 million tonnes of waste are produced in the UK each\nyear, of which around 250 million tonnes is controlled waste. \nTable 1 (overleaf) summarises the DoE's estimates of wastes arising and their disposal routes.\nThese figures suggest that, in 1990, some 125 million tonnes of controlled waste went to\nlandfill in the UK. Around 90% of household waste and 72% of all controlled waste goes\nto landfill. Only 5% of household waste and 20% of all controlled waste is recycled or re-\nused.\nEvidence from Scotland, where reliable surveys of local authority waste management are\ncarried out annually, suggests that the predominance of landfilling has not declined\nsignificantly since 1990. In 1990, Scottish local authorities disposed of around 9.7 million\ntonnes of controlled waste to landfill, which represented 95% of total controlled waste\nretained for disposal. In 1992, they landfilled some 12.2 million tonnes, around 90% of the\ntotal.17\nSomewhat more reliable figures are available on the generation and disposal of special wastes,\nprincipally because the regulation of such waste has required waste regulation authorities\n(now the environment agencies), to monitor its movement. In 1993/94, special waste arisings\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n14 Special Waste Regulations SI 1996/972\n15 For example, only 57% of authorities responded in 1994-95: CIPFA Waste Disposal Statistics 1994-95\nActuals p.2\n16 DoE, Environment information strategy review - report of the review of waste management information 1995\n17 Scottish Office, Statistical Bulletin Environment Series ENV/1995/2 Waste Collection, Disposal and\nRegulation Statistics 1992\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nin the UK totalled slightly over 2 million tonnes. Of the 1.9 million tonnes retained for\ndisposal by WRAs in England and Wales, slightly less than half, 0.9 million tonnes, went to\nco-disposal (see page 17) landfill sites. A further 0.6 million tonnes were physically or\nchemically treated, processes which can take waste outside of the definition of special waste.\n Some of this treated waste will also have been sent to landfill18. \nTable 1 Management of UK Controlled Waste(a)\nManagement method\nType of waste Total wastes\narising\nLandfill Incineration Recycled/re-\nused\nOther\nHousehold \n   million tonnes\n   % of total\n20\n100%\n18\n90%\n1\n5%\n1\n5%\n0\n0%\nCommercial \n   million tonnes\n   % of total\n15\n100%\n13\n85%\n1\n8%\n1\n8%\n0\n0%\nConstruction & demolition \n   million tonnes\n   % of total\n70\n100%\n44\n63%\n0\n0%\n21\n30%\n5\n7%\nOther industrial\n   million tonnes\n   % of total\n70\n100%\n51\n73%\n1\n1%\n13\n18%\n4\n6%\nAll controlled wastes(a)\n   million tonnes\n   % of total\n175\n100%\n126\n72%\n3\n2%\n36\n20%\n9\n5%\na) Excludes sewage sludge and dredged spoils\nFigures may not sum to totals due to rounding.\nSource: Cm 3040 Figures 1.1, 1.2\nB. Landfill sites\nIn Making Waste Work19 the Government listed the advantages of landfill. It is inexpensive;\nsuitable for a wide range of wastes; there is a large capacity remaining in some areas; landfill\ngas is a clean source of fuel for heat and power generation; restored land provides valuable\nspace for wildlife and leisure activities; and well designed landfills can be unobtrusive.\nHowever, it noted that all landfills need careful management to ensure that their potential for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n18 DoE, Digest of Environmental Statistics (18) 1996 Table 7.4(b)\n19 Cm 3040 December 1995 p.62\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\npollution is minimised, and pointed out the potential disadvantages of landfill:\n• versatility and convenience of landfill make it less attractive for waste\nproducers to be innovative in the way in which they deal with their\nwastes\n• however well engineered, there is a finite risk of contamination from\noperational landfill sites;\n• landfill gas can pose significant risks including release of methane,\nan important greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere;\n• after landfilling, the land may retain some contamination and so be\nunsuitable for some uses;\n• noise, odour and unsightliness, and vehicle movements, may cause\nnuisance, in common with all waste disposal and recovery activities,\nand;\n• energy recovery from landfill is less efficient than some other\ndisposal options such as incineration.\n1. Landfill gas\nAccording to 1991 DoE guidance:20\n\"An increasing number of incidents and growing public concern have focused\nattention on the fate of the end-products of waste degradation in landfill sites and their\neffects on the environment. One major area of concern is the evolution of landfill gas\nwhich, when inadequately controlled, has led to explosions, fires, dangerous gas\nconcentrations in and around houses, odour nuisance and vegetation dieback.\" \nLandfill gas arises through the breakdown of biodegradable wastes inside a landfill.\nBiodegradable wastes include paper, wood and animal and vegetable matter, and as microbes\nbreak these materials down, usually in conditions of little oxygen, they produce a mixture of\ngases comprising mostly carbon dioxide (around 35%) and methane (around 65%). The gas\ngiven off, or evolved, through microbial activity may mix with other gases in the landfill,\nperhaps giving rise to odours. It also comes out of the site moist and warm21 so it needs to\nbe treated before it can be burnt, for instance, and it is more likely to act as a corrosive. It\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 DoE, Landfill Gas 2nd edition, Waste management paper No.27 1991 p.13\n21 DoE/Welsh Office, Renewable Energy:Planning Policy Guidance Note 22: Annex on using landfill gas,\nOctober 1994\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\ncan travel through and away from the site along pathways such as sewers, cavities or natural\nfissures if these exist, or it may dissolve into leachates (liquids that have seeped through a\nlandfill extracting substances from the wastes en route) or groundwater and be transported in\nthat way. If not properly managed, landfill gas can give rise to flammability, toxicity and\nasphyxiation hazards, and bare patches, brown foliage and dieback in vegetation. \nIt may take from 3 months to a year before methane is evolved in significant amounts from\na site, and the process may continue for well over 15 years22, or even for 'many decades' after\nfilling with wastes has finished23. \nMethane (CH4) is one of gases which has contributed most to the enhanced greenhouse effect\nwhich may be leading to global warming24. The amounts of methane in the atmosphere have\nbeen increasing since the start of the 19th century and current levels are the highest ever\nobserved, including records from ice cores which go back 160,000 years. While the rate of\nincrease in the 1980s was lower than that of the 1970s, atmospheric methane is still\nincreasing. It is estimated that, globally, 20-40% of current methane emissions come from\nnatural sources (including the digestive systems of animals, rotting vegetation, anaerobic bogs\nand so on), 20% from fossil fuel related sources (such as the burning of coal and leakage\nfrom gas mains), and 40-60% from other man-made sources, including landfill25. \nIn the UK landfill is the single greatest source of methane, with around 46% of the UK's total\nemissions probably coming from landfill in 1994. The next largest contributions came from\ncattle at 21%; other sources (such as deep-mined coal, gas leakage and sheep) contributed\nunder 10% each26. In its report on the Incineration of Waste the Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Pollution noted:27\n\"Nearly all of [the UK's municipal waste] goes to landfill where it produces both\ncarbon dioxide and methane and contributes substantially to the greenhouse effect.\nMethane has a particularly strong effect ... by incinerating municipal waste rather than\nlandfilling it a significant and worthwhile contribution could be made to reducing\nemissions of greenhouse gases.\" \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n22 DoE, Landfill Gas 2nd edition, 1991\n23 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, Landfill gas: a report on the findings of surveys carried out by\n[HMIP] to assess the scale of the problem and provide recommendations for further action, DEP 6963 April\n1991\n24 see Global warming: environmental and economic effects, Library Research Paper 95/85, 7 July 1995 and\nGlobal warming: policy responses, Library Research Paper 95/86, 14 July 1995\n25 IPCC, Climate Change 1995 The Science of Climate Change.

The rate of methane production will also depend on\nthe composition, density and input rate of the landfilled waste, the moisture, temperature and\nacidity/alkalinity of the site, and the site's physical characteristics, which will affect the ease\nwith which the gas can escape. \nOf course the amount of methane evolved from a site will also depend on the control\nmeasures in place or the amount being harnessed. A particular problem in the past has been\nold sites, often closed local authority landfills, which had been neither designed nor operated\nwith gas control in mind. In 1987 HMIP wrote to all waste disposal authorities drawing to\ntheir attention the need to ensure that all landfill licences contained appropriate conditions for\nlandfill gas management, and a 1991 report from HMIP estimated that just over 1,000 sites\n(both active and closed, and private and local authority run) might need gas controls\ninstalled28. Following the 1990 EPA, the DoE issued guidance stating that all sites should be\nconsidered as having the potential to generate landfill gas, and that:29 \n\"No [landfill] licence should be issued until the [waste regulation authority] is\nsatisfied with the gas monitoring, and where necessary, gas control arrangements, as\ndetailed in the working plan.\" \nMonitoring measures comprise boreholes sunk around the perimeter of the site which can be\nused to check the performance of the gas extraction system and to ensure that gas is not\nmigrating sideways and out; they will end in a small cap or box above ground, and can be\nchecked using either installed or portable dataloggers30. Control measures may involve the\nuse of barriers with vent trenches or pipes used in conjunction with an active pumping system\nwhen passive venting is inadequate. When a gas is not combustible it can be directly vented\nto the atmosphere, or else support fuel can be added to burn it in a flarestack; this reduces\nassociated odour problems31. Gas flaring also reduces the amount of methane emitted to the\natmosphere, by converting it to carbon dioxide, a less powerful greenhouse gas32. \nRather than simply venting or flaring off landfill gas, it can be harnessed for energy. One\nstep up the waste hierarchy from disposal is recovery, and energy recovery from waste\nprojects are provided specifically for in the Non Fossil Fuel Obligations (NFFO). NFFO\nOrders require electricity companies to buy electricity at a premium rate from designated\nproducers who are not using fossil fuels; while they were originally aimed at nuclear power\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n28 HMIP, Landfill gas, DEP 6963 April 1991\n29 DoE, Landfill Gas 2nd edition, 1991 p.10\n30 Environment Agency, Landfill restoration and post closure management:consultation draft, Waste\nmanagement paper 26E, August 1996 p.233\n31 ibid\n32 DoE Climate Change; The UK Programme Cm 2427 January 1994 p.40\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nthey now cover renewables.

Prospective new landfill gas generating\nstations have to be from licensed sites where tipping was being carried out prior to 22 July\n199335. \nFriends of the Earth have said that \"only in a tiny fraction of possible cases is [landfill] gas\ncollected and used for fuel,\"36 although this statement was based on the results of a 1989\nsurvey. In the UK in 1994 around 163,000 tonnes of methane from landfills was being used\nto generate electricity37 and this was well over twice the amount harnessed in 199038.\nNevertheless, an estimated 1,790,000 tonnes of methane in total was emitted from landfills\nin 199439. The government has set a target of 300MW of electricity being generated from\nlandfill gas by the year 2000, which is one fifth of its overall target from renewable sources,\nand would mean using 520,000 tonnes of methane each year40. \nGenerally, electricity generation plants are situated at the landfill site, and the generation\nequipment, such as large spark ignition engines or gas turbines, are integrated with the gas\nextraction plant. Alternatively the gas can be pumped to a nearby end user, to provide heat\nin industrial processes such as firing and drying in brick and cement manufacturers, or raising\nsteam for the drying and bleaching of textiles or paper, heating commercial greenhouses or\nfood processing. Flarestacks are still needed to regulate the gas at a site whether or not\nenergy is extracted, and the gas may need a range of pre-treatments, particularly de-watering,\nbefore it can be used as a fuel41. \nHowever, Friends of the Earth make the point that being able to make use of some landfill\ngas is not a justification for continuing the practice of extensive landfill and their views\nreflect the waste hierarchy:42\n\"Landfilling waste is associated with a wide range of environmental problems. Using\nlandfill gas to generate energy only recovers a small fraction of the energy that is lost\nwhen the waste is landfilled- far greater energy savings are made if the waste is not\nproduced in the first place or if it is reused or recycled. Therefore the use of landfill\ngas as an energy source should not been seen as a justification for the continuing\nlandfilling of the vast majority of our waste.\" \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n35 DTI Press Release P/95/769 Richard Page sets up next renewable electricity round (NFFO) 2.11.95\n36 FoE Briefing Sheet Landfill gas and climate change, May 1992\n37 Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Nineteenth Report - Sustainable Use of Soil, Cm 3165\nFebruary 1996 p.113\n38 ibid\n39 DoE Digest of Environmental Statistics No. 18, 1996 Table 1.3\n40 Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution Nineteenth Report Sustainable Use of Soil Cm 3165, February\n1996 p.113\n41 DoE/Welsh Office, Renewable Energy:Planning Policy Guidance Note 22: Annex on using landfill gas,\nOctober 1994\n42 FoE Briefing Sheet,Landfill gas and climate change, May 1992\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\n2. Co-disposal sites and inert material\nWhile landfill gas arises through biological degradation of waste, leachates form through both\nbiological and purely chemical reactions. Landfilled waste releases inorganic and organic\nmaterials, and also as reactions take place the products may become dissolved into solution.\nWith regard to co-disposal sites and sites accepting special waste, the DoE note that43:\n\"Although most landfills are chemical reactors, the reactions are particularly\nsignificant at a special waste or co-disposal landfill\"\nWhen the waste regulation authority/environment agency licence a landfill site, the DoE suggests44\nthat it may be useful to classify the site in two ways: firstly according to the types of waste it will\naccept, and secondly by the extent to which it is designed to contain pollutants; this will help\ndecide how complex and difficult the proposed site will be to operate.\nA suggested scheme is, according to waste accepted;\nSites which accept inert waste only\nSites which accept industrial waste that does not consist of and does not include\nspecial waste\nSites which accept other non-inert controlled waste that does not consist of and does\nnot include special waste; a combination of a special waste and some other controlled\nwaste if they can be disposed of together\nSites which accept special waste only\nAnd according to the principles of operation and containment;\nSites which include containment sites which are designed to allow no significant\nrelease of leachate, or migration of landfill gas\nSites that need few such measures, because the waste types/environmental setting pose\nno significant threat to the environment\nWhile many sites were licensed under CoPA 1974 to accept 'inert' wastes, the definition used\nat that time was not adequate, because it included materials that in fact degraded very slowly,\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n43 DoE, Licensing of waste management facilities 3rd edition, Waste management paper No.4 1994 p.43\n44 ibid p.41\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nsuch as wood from demolition sites. The practice of setting arbitrary limits to allow some\nsmall contamination of non-inert waste such as 5 or 10% for paper and cardboard was also\nconsidered ineffective and unenforceable by 1994; only genuinely inert waste should be\npermitted at sites licensed for inert waste. The DoE recommended that licence conditions\nspecify acceptable wastes such as soil, sand, clay, stone, concrete, bricks, slate, glass and\nceramics45. \nIn stark contrast to the complex reactions that may take place in a co-disposal site or a site\naccepting special wastes, \"landfill sites taking truly inert material will not produce significant\nconcentrations of pollutants. No important chemical or biological processes will take place\nin the site.\"46 It is unlikely that landfill gas or leachates will ever be generated in a truly inert\nsite which has never taken non-inert wastes, so the costs of running the site, of post-closure\nremediation and possible costs to the environment will be far lower.\nAt special waste or co-disposal sites, extra measures are needed. For instance, the location\nof any special waste deposit should be notified to the Environment Agency, and on-site\nlaboratory facilities may be needed for the analysis of waste accepted. \nThe acceptance of unauthorised waste at a landfill is an offence. For example, a waste\nproducer, carrier and landfill operator were recently fined £8000 plus costs following a\nprosecution brought by the Environment Agency after a consignment of special waste was\nbrought to a site and deposited, although it was later found to contain wastes not permitted\nby the site licence. The case was brought under CoPA 1974 and the EPA 1990 and came\nto light when a drum containing hydrochloric acid burst open during tipping; hydrofluoric\nacid was also included in the consignment. An Environment Agency spokesman stressed that\nsimilar cases involving breaches of the duty of care and legislation designed to protect the\nenvironment would be prosecuted by the Agency, and commented that 'It is vital that only\nwaste permitted by the site licence is accepted by landfill operators'.47,48 \nSimilarly, the Environment Agency has successfully prosecuted a Cambridgeshire landfill\noperator who held a landfill licence for chalk, soil and subsoil but had accepted concrete,\nasphalt, wood and green plastic piping. The operator was fined £10,000 plus costs49. \nIn one of the series of Industry Profiles sponsored by its Contaminated Land and Liabilities\nDivision, the DoE describes briefly the poor landfill practices which existed before regulation\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n45 ibid\n46 DoE Landfill Completion Waste management paper No.26A, 1993 p.4\n47 Croner Waste Management Briefing No. 47, 1 August 1996 p.4\n48\n\"Dicing with death at the landfill face\", ENDS Report 258, July 1996 pp 21-23\n49\n\"Landfill operator fined\" Croner Environment Briefing No.53, 19 June 1996 p.1\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nand the increased awareness of the potential hazards of landfill50:\n\"Landfill sites were originally small informal and uncontrolled tips used by local\nauthorities or industry for the disposal of waste to land ... Prior to the 1970s the\nmajority had little or no engineering control of wastes beyond that provided by the\nlocal topography and geology.\"\nIn 1994 a company called UK Waste, which had been auditing 158 landfill sites with a view\nto acquiring these, released the results of its survey which showed, it said, poor engineering\nstandards at many sites. While UK Waste reportedly has a policy of operating only\ncontainment sites with at least a single containment liner, plus leachate and gas management\nand monitoring systems, it found that of all sites surveyed (68 of which were closed and 90\noperational) 54% had no leachate collection systems and half had no gas control systems.\nOf the operational sites, 22% were on in situ clay, 17% had a single liner and 12% composite\nliners; the rest, around half, had no liners but were so called 'dilute and disperse' sites. UK\nWaste alleged that this meant its costs for landfilling were in the mid-teens per tonne while\nother operators could undercut them at £5-10 per tonne. The company criticised the practice\nof allowing old landfill sites to continue operating 'indefinitely until they were full', and also\ncalled on the DoE to make it clear that co-disposal should not be carried out in anything but\nengineered containment sites.51 \n3. Completion and restoration \nA landfill licence cannot be surrendered unless the Environment Agency accepts this\nsurrender; the Agency must inspect the land and be satisfied that the site is unlikely to cause\npollution of the environment or harm to human health (and thereby meets the so-called\n'completion condition' under the 1990 EPA). It can then issue a 'completion certificate'. \nTo check whether a site meets the 'completion condition' the quantity and quality of leachate\npresent, the flow and concentration of gas, the future potential for leachate and gas to be\nformed, any physical instability and the presence of particular problem wastes all need to be\nconsidered. Each site needs a case by case assessment. \nRestoration is the process through which a landfill site is returned to a condition suitable for\nafter-use. Draft Waste Management Paper (WMP) 26E on Landfill restoration and post\nclosure management52 has just been issued and the consultation period ends on 18 November\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n50 DoE, Waste recycling, treatment and disposal sites landfills and other waste treatment or disposal sites, 1996\n51\n\"UK Waste hits out at landfill standards\", ENDS Report, December 1994 pp 10-11\n52 Environment Agency, August 1996\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\n199653. The Environment Agency emphasises the need for a holistic approach\nto landfill, to integrate the process \"from initial concept to final capping, restoration and\naftercare.\" \nSeveral after-use options exist and include agriculture, woodland, amenity or nature\nconservation, or 'hard end' uses (such as a car park). In the past agricultural uses (particularly\nas pasture) have been the most common after-use for landfill sites, but this could be attributed\nto the importance attached to agricultural production and concerns about the feasibility of\nother uses; for example, planting trees on a capped site has in the past been discouraged, but\nthis advice is now being reviewed. \nProblems in the past have often resulted from a lack or loss of suitable restoration materials\nin the form of suitable topsoils, the availability of which are critical in the choice of afteruse\n(although on-site soil substitutes such as dredgings, sediment, spoils or waste limestone may\nbe used as subsoils to reduce the amount of soil that needs to be imported to a site). The\ntype of waste which a site has accepted is another important influence in the choice of\nafteruse; a site that has taken largely inert wastes will be suitable for a range of afteruses\nincluding hard development. Conversely a site containing biodegradable wastes, particularly\na deep site, will probably not be suitable for a hard end use because it will experience\nproblems of unstable and contaminated ground and of landfill gas generation. \nThe pollution control systems needed on a closed landfill may include a capping layer,\nleachate and landfill gas systems, and monitoring points for settlement, groundwater quality,\nleachate and gas. While many old landfills are not capped, and inert sites may not need a\ncapping system, where one is used it may be constructed of clay, a synthetic material, a\npurpose-designed geotextile or a combination of these. Detailed advice is given by the\nEnvironment Agency in draft WMP 26E as to the design of capping and gas and leachate\nsystems. \n4. Planning and other controls\nAs well as the usual planning system which operates through the Town and Country Planning\nAct 1990 in England and Wales and through the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act\n1972 as amended, landfills are subject to extra controls. The Government's planning policy\nguidance notes, particularly PPG 2354, give advice on how the planning system relates to\nlandfill sites, and the Environment Agency's draft Waste Management Paper 26E55 gives a\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n53 HC Deb 16.10.96 c.1059W\n54 DoE, Planning and Pollution Control, July 1994\n55 Landfill restoration and post closure management, August 1996\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nuseful summary of the planning framework. \nThe Planning and Compensation Act 1991 allows local authorities to impose five year\n'aftercare periods' to follow the completion of any restoration conditions at any site where\nrefuse or waste has been deposited. Under the 1990 EPA landfill licences may also have\nconditions attached relating to aftercare (ie, to the period after landfill operations have\nfinished). In addition, the waste regulation authority often requires a restoration plan to be\nsubmitted with the application for a waste management licence. Applicants must show that\nthey have arranged funding for long term obligations, such as monitoring water and landfill\ngas56. \nThe Environment Agency is thought to be currently reviewing its policy regarding the\nprovision of financial guarantees for landfill sites. There has been speculation that it favours\nthe use of escrow accounts (an independent fund into which the operator pays a fixed sum\nper tonne of waste landfilled). The money is not tax deductible until spent and is not under\nthe operator's control. The Environmental Services Association, the trade association which\nrepresents much of the waste disposal industry, has commented that 'Locking away millions\nof pounds at low interest won't help anyone' and favours companies being able to simply\nmake provision in their accounts. Several companies have called on the Agency not to make\nescrow accounts a normal condition of a landfill licence, and to reduce the sums involved57.\nDirective 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment58 requires Member States to\nensure that projects likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of their\nnature, size or location are subject to environmental assessment (EA). The assessment can\nthen be used by the planning authority when deciding whether to grant planning permission.\nEA is required for projects listed in two Annexes to the Directive, roughly equivalent to the\nSchedules of the UK implementing regulations. Landfill sites for special waste will always\nrequire EA and other landfill sites probably will if they have a capacity of over 75,000 tonnes\na year59. (The Directive is presently being tightened.) Sites accepting inert waste only are\nunlikely to need EA60. The developer has to submit a plan along with the planning\napplication describing the site's nature and size, to let the local planning authority decide\nwhether the development is likely to require full EA.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n56 Environment Agency, Landfill restoration and post closure management: consultation draft, Waste\nManagement Paper 26E August 1996 p.19\n57\n\"Landfill operators battle to limit burden of financial guarantees\", ENDS Report 260, September 1996 p.13\n58 implemented in England and Wales primarily through the Town and Country Planning (Assessment of\nEnvironmental Effects) Regulations SI 1199/1988 and in Scotland by the Environmental Assessment\n(Scotland) Regulations SI 1988/1221, both as amended\n59 DoE Circular 15/88 (Welsh Office 23/88), Environmental Assessment, 12 July 1988\n60 Environment Agency,  Landfill restoration and post closure management: consultation draft, August 1996\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIII Landfill tax \nA. First proposals for a tax on waste\nThe idea that new taxes can be used to tackle environmental problems was given serious\nconsideration in the White Paper This Common Inheritance - a review of all aspects of UK\nenvironmental policy published in 1990. \"Taxes can be the most effective means of tackling\nenvironmental problems, and so merit serious examination\", it was suggested, though this\nstatement was qualified by the observation that, \"their use raises wider economic, social and\nindustrial consequences which need to be weighed in the balance.\"61 Nonetheless, the White\nPaper made a strong case that governments could not rely solely on regulation in any\neffective environmental strategy:62\n1.25 If Governments want to stop something happening, or make something happen\nin a different way, they have broadly two choices: they can by law lay down rules\nand regulations on standards to be met or equipment to be installed; or they can use\nthe market to influence the behaviour of producers and their customers. Whichever\ncourse they choose, the objective is to make those who cause environmental damage\nface the costs of control in full, without subsidy. That is called the \"polluter pays\"\nprinciple which the Government, in common with many other Governments, adopts.\nIf we impose higher standards centrally, this puts extra costs on producers and on\ntheir customers in turn; if we use price signals, for example by imposing charges or\ntaxes on certain activities, extra costs again fall on the manufacturers, and then on\ntheir customers. This \"polluter pays\" principle is an important means of influencing\npotential polluters.\n1.26 In the past, governments in Britain and elsewhere have mostly used regulation\nto control pollution. \"Fog everywhere\", wrote Dickens about Victorian London.\nEventually, the British Government used the law to impose regulations to clean up\nLondon's air. And there are large numbers of laws and regulations to protect the\nquality of our water and air and to control disposal of wastes on land. This regulatory\napproach has served Britain and other countries well, and it will remain an important\npart of future environmental controls. For example, our new system of integrated\npollution control will regulate industrial processes of all types to ensure the best\noutcome for the environment as a whole.\n1.27 Regulation, however, does have limitations. It can be expensive to monitor and\ndifficult to up-date quickly in response to scientific and technical advance. It cannot\nalways pitch controls at the level which strikes the most cost-effective balance\nbetween environmental benefits and compliance costs. Compliance costs can fall\nwidely - on business, on Government, and on consumers - and are easy to\nunderestimate in advance.

In short, regulation has always been\nrequired and is still required, but it has its shortcomings.\n1.28 For these reasons the Government, along with other Governments throughout the\nworld, has begun to look for ways to control pollution which avoid some of these\nproblems by working with the grain of the market. The ideas include various forms\nof pollution charges, as well as taxes and other economic instruments, all designed to\nencourage consumers and producers to behave in ways which benefit the environment\n...\n1.29 These new approaches have been described loosely as the market-based approach\nto the environment, since they involve integrating economic and environmental\nconcerns and applying market economics more broadly. In the Government's view,\nmarket mechanisms offer the prospect of a more efficient and flexible response to\nenvironmental issues, both old and new.\nIndeed, the \"polluter pays\" principle - that the cost of preventing pollution or minimising\nenvironmental damage due to pollution should be borne by those responsible for the pollution\n- is one of the foundations of the EC's environmental policy.63 Though the White Paper\nargued that those responsible for waste discharges should pay for the social cost of disposing\nof that waste, it did not propose a landfill levy, instead referring to recycling credits and to\nmarket forces pushing the costs of disposal generally:64\nThe Government's policy is to harness market forces more effectively to encourage\nwaste minimisation. The Environmental Protection Bill establishes a strict\nenvironmental regime for the disposal of waste, whether it is burned (incineration) or\nput in the ground (landfill). One effect of this will be to make waste disposal much\nmore expensive. Increasing disposal costs will in turn provide a strong incentive for\nindustry to cut down the volume of waste it produces and to make more use of\ncleaner technologies.\nIn 1993 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution published a report - Incineration\nof Waste65 - which made the case that the methods of waste disposal posed a serious\nenvironmental problem, in part because the pricing of different methods did not accurately\nreflect their true costs. The report included an analysis by Aspinwall & Co of the relative\ncosts of waste disposal by landfill and incineration. The Commission pointed out that both\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n63 In fact the principle is included in the Treaty of Rome: National Society for Clean Air Pollution Handbook\n1996, p.5 \n64 op.cit. p.187\n65 Cm 2181 May 1993. The Commission's views on the competing claims of incineration and landfill were\ndiscussed above, in section I A of this paper.\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nthis report, and a second one on landfill costs produced by Coopers & Lybrand66, excluded\nthe environmental costs associated with incineration and landfill:67\nThese environmental costs do not have to be met by the operators of a waste disposal\nfacility, and in consequence are unlikely to be taken into account in their investment\nand operational decisions. In other words, the private costs to the operator are not\nlikely to reflect fully the overall cost of waste disposal to the community. If disposal\ncharges are as a result lower than the full economic costs of disposal (including the\nenvironmental costs), the quantities of waste sent for disposal may be larger, and the\nproportion recycled smaller, than would be the case if the charges reflected the full\neconomic costs. Moreover the methods of disposal chosen may not correspond with\nthe best practicable environmental option.\nFor its part, the Coopers & Lybrand report on a landfill levy68 estimated that the costs of\nlandfill could rise by between 37 and 135% by the year 2000 in some scenarios (eg, inner\ncities where land is expensive), approaching or exceeding the cost of incineration even\nwithout a levy. Even so, it went on to conclude that if a levy were to be introduced its\nprimary effect would be an increase in the amount of waste being incinerated, especially in\nhigh landfill cost urban areas, where incineration was expected to become progressively more\nattractive than landfill.\nThe Royal Commission noted pretreatment of landfill waste by incineration could reduce the\nlong term risks from pollution, the production of greenhouse gases, and the incidence of\nleaching from landfill sites (since incinerated waste in the form of slag and ash is biologically\ninactive by comparison with raw municipal waste), as well as cut the volume of waste\ndeposited in landfill by up to 90%. However, those using landfill sites had to see incineration\nas financially desirable, something that the current pricing structure could not deliver. As a\nconsequence, the Commission recommended that a levy be applied to all waste deposited in\nlandfill sites:69\nWe are convinced that a levy on waste disposal is justifiable in order to reflect the\ncost to the community of the environmental effects of waste disposal and the benefit\nfrom the reduced use of raw materials and energy made possible by recycling. We\nwould expect the cost of a levy to be passed on in charges to waste disposal\nauthorities, and in turn passed on by them to households through higher council tax\npayments and to firms through charges for the disposal of commercial waste. Both\nhouseholds and (more directly) firms would then have an incentive to produce less\nwaste and recycle waste materials, so reducing levels of pollution.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n66 DoE, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market distortions, NS 8852 February 1993\n67 Cm 2181 May 1993 para 9.30\n68 DoE, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market distortions, NS 8852 February 1993\n69 Cm 2181 May 1993 para 9.34\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nOne other reason for a levy, mentioned in the Coopers and Lybrand report, was that it could\nprovide a clean up fund for managing later environmental difficulties which might arise.\nEnvironmental Trusts were first mentioned in a consultation paper - issued by Customs &\nExcise in March 1995:70 non-profit making distributing bodies, in the private sector, making\ngrants to restore closed landfill sites, and financing research into more sustainable waste\nmanagement practices. Their introduction is discussed in detail in section IV C of this paper.\nB. Government consultation on the tax\n1. Basis of the tax\nWhen he first proposed a new tax on landfill in his 1994 Budget speech, the Chancellor,\nKenneth Clarke, argued that the tax would achieve the twin objectives of raising money and\nprotecting the environment, without adding to the burdens of business:71\nTaxes can play an important role in protecting the environment. One major\nproblem is the disposal of waste. I would like to make an announcement\ntoday to help tackle the problem. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of\nState for the Environment and I will issue shortly a consultation paper\nsetting out details of a new tax to be collected by Customs and Excise on\nwaste disposed in landfill. We propose that a new landfill tax should come\ninto effect in 1996. It should raise several hundred million pounds a year.\nBut I am determined not to impose additional costs on business overall. I\nshall therefore be looking at ways to offset the impact of the new tax by\nmaking further compensatory reductions in the level of employer national\ninsurance contributions when the new tax is introduced. In brief, I want to\nraise tax on polluters to make further cuts in the tax on jobs.\nThe consultation paper issued in March 1995 proposed an ad valorem basis for the tax, with\nthe aim of striking \"the best balance between environmental justification and practical\nfeasibility.\"72 An ad valorem tax was preferred to a specific duty charged by reference to\nweight or volume of waste disposed. It was argued that this provided \"a straightforward\nproxy for the environmental impacts of landfill disposal\", and that an ad valorem tax would\nhave lower compliance costs and would be easier to police than other possible taxes.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n70 HM Customs & Excise, Landfill Tax - a consultation paper, March 1995 p.11. The paper was issued to\ngather views on the design of the tax, following the Chancellor's announcement the previous November.\n71 HC Deb 29.11.94 c.1098\n72 HM Customs & Excise, Landfill Tax - a consultation paper, March 1995 p.5\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nA number of respondents argued that the practical effects of an ad valorem tax might well\nconflict with the environmental objectives of the Government had in introducing it, in\nparticular by encouraging those disposing of waste to use the cheapest sites, sites which most\nlikely have lower environmental standards, and transporting their waste longer distances by\nroad to reach these sites. In addition, it was thought an ad valorem charge would result in\nmore illegal tipping of waste (\"fly-tipping\"; see below), and hit those local authorities in areas\nwhere land was relatively scarce for landfill sites. As a consequence in August the\nChancellor announced that landfill tax would be weight-based, charged per tonne of waste,\nand that inert waste would be subject to a reduced rate of tax.73 The announcement was\ngenerally welcomed, notably by the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors.74\n2. Local authorities\nAn important characteristic of the tax is that it is to be charged on all those who use landfill\n- local authorities just as much as private companies. Indeed, in the consultation process that\nhas followed the 1994 Budget announcement, the Government has consistently emphasised\nthat for the tax to achieve its purpose, it would have to affect the behaviour of all those who\nuse landfill sites. For example, in a long written answer in March 1996 the then Paymaster\nGeneral, David Heathcoat-Amory noted the following:75\n\"The underlying purpose of the tax is to make environmental costs [of waste\ndisposal] explicit and ensure that those contemplating activities with\nenvironmental impacts take account of those costs. The tax will also\nprovide an incentive for waste producers to look for new ways to reduce the\namount of waste they produce.\"\nIn the March 1995 consultation paper, the impact of the new charge on local authorities was\ndiscussed:76\nLocal authorities are responsible for the collection and disposal of household wastes,\nand the cost of tax in respect of such wastes would fall on them ... [the Government\nis to] look at ways to offset the impact of the new tax by making reductions in the\nlevel of employer national insurance contributions when the tax is introduced. This\nwill also benefit local authorities.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n73 HM Customs & Excise press notice, Chancellor strengthens landfill tax, 2 August 1995\n74\n\"Landfill tax to be based on weight\", Financial Times, 3 August 1995\n75 HC Deb 12.3.96 cc 550-552W\n76 HM Customs & Excise Landfill Tax - A Consultation Paper, March 1995 p.4\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIn September 1995 HM Customs & Excise published a report on the responses it had received\nto the consultation paper. One issue raised by correspondents had been the impact of the new\ntax on local authorities:77\n6. Effect  of  the  tax  on  local  authorities\nAs indicated above, local authorities were particularly active in expressing their views\nand concerns, which included:\n• fly-tipping - cost of policing and removal;\n• cost of the tax and how it will be met, including the gap between the tax burden and\nbenefit of employers' national insurance contributions (NICS) reductions, although\nthere was a great deal of uncertainty about the net financial impact;\n• whether local authorities will be able to pass on the cost of the tax to householders\nvia the Council Tax; and\n• the lack of incentive that the tax offers to those ultimately producing waste to\nchange their behaviour, particularly householders.\nThe Government's response was included in Customs' report:78\nThe Government recognises taxes will never be universally popular but welcomes the\nsupport received for the tax which it believes will help curb damage to the\nenvironment. This will be introduced as planned on 1 October 1996 ...\nThe concerns of local authorities are also understood by the Government. Local\nauthorities are responsible for the collection and disposal of household waste, and it\nis recognised that the cost of the tax in respect of such waste that is landfilled will fall\non them. The proposed reductions in employers' NICs will affect local authorities\nand, over the coming months, the Government will address the issue of the financial\nimpact of the tax on local authorities in the context of the local government finance\nsettlement.\nWhen the tax was debated on the floor of the House in January 1996, David Heathcoat-\nAmory emphasised that some businesses and some local authorities would see an increase in\ntheir costs as a consequence of this new impost:79\n\"There are bound to be winners and losers. Not all businesses or types of\nbusiness will unequivocally be winners because they will incur landfill tax\ncharges that are greater than any benefit that they receive in national\ninsurance contributions. That is true for local authorities as a whole.\"\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n77 HM Customs & Excise, Landfill Tax - report on responses received to consultation paper, September 1995\npp 4-5\n78 op.cit. p.6\n79 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.170\n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nSome have argued that the \"losers\" from a landfill levy will include council taxpayers. The\nScottish Local Government Information Unit, funded by Scottish local authorities and trade\nunions, has claimed the tax will probably not increase recycling rates in the near future,\nbecause the cost of setting up recycling operations to reduce the amounts of landfill tax paid\nwill \"require additional resources which local authorities, in the light of the last budget\nsettlement, will be unable to meet.\"80 Indeed, the 1993 Coopers & Lybrand study on a\nlandfill levy estimated that in the short term a landfill tax of £10 per tonne would lead to a\n£5 per head increase in council tax in England and Wales, falling to £3 per head as local\nauthorities found alternatives to landfill.81\n3. Fly-tipping\nThe second issue that Customs found caused especial concern was the impact of the new tax\non fly-tipping:82 \n5. Effect  on  fly-tipping\nConcern over fly-tipping was one of the most common themes in responses received.\n273 respondents (38 per cent) believed that the tax could or would lead to an increase\nin fly-tipping. Of these, 187 were from local authorities (57 per cent of local\nauthorities who replied). Thirteen site operators also believed that the tax might\nincrease fly-tipping, as did a number of trade associations.\nThe following concerns/questions about the fly-tipping issue recurred within these\nreplies:\n• Fly-tipping will increase which will be detrimental to the environment and thus\ncounter to one of the main objectives of the tax.\n• Who will remove fly-tipped waste and who, if anyone, will pay the tax on it?\n• Both local authorities and Customs will find it difficult to detect and enforce any\npenalties given their lack of resources.\n• Greater policing and penalties must be introduced to deal with fly-tipping.\nAt the time, the Government conceded fly-tipping could be a problem, but that the existing\nregulatory regime would be sufficient deterrent against its growth:83\nOther countries which have a landfall tax in place appear not to have significant\nproblems with fly-tipping, although the Government is naturally concerned to see that\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n80\n\"A new rubbish tax\", Scottish Local Government No. 86, October 1996 \n81 DoE, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market distortions, NS 8852 February 1993 p.vi\n82 Landfill Tax - report on responses ..., September 1995 pp 4-5\n83 ibid p.6\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nwaste disposal methods are adequately policed after the introduction of the tax. The\nmain security against fly-tipping is the regulatory framework. Regulations\nimplemented on 1 May 1994 introduced a new waste management licensing system.\nThese controls, along with section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and\nthe associated duty of care for waste which came into force on 1 April 1992, are\nintended to address the problem of fly-tipping, amongst other matters. They should\nprovide a strong regulatory framework to support the new tax. Further thought will\nbe given to the policing of the landfall tax and of waste disposal methods over the\ncoming months.\nThe Government reiterated its position on fly-tipping at the time of the November 1995\nBudget:84 \nThe Government has also responded to concern expressed during the consultation\nexercise that fly-tipping may increase as a result of the tax. The current waste\nmanagement licensing system and duty of care for waste provide a strong regulatory\nframework to support the tax. Fly-tipping is already a criminal offence and the\nGovernment therefore sees no need to make it a revenue offence in tax law.\nHowever, it will take further steps to combat fly-tipping when the tax is implemented.\nIn particular, the Environment Agencies will be asked to give a high priority to the\nprevention of fly-tipping. The courts will be reminded about the environmental\nimpact of fly-tipping and the financial gains which are made by perpetrators.\nFurther details of the Government's policy to deal with fly-tipping were given by the\nSecretary of State:85\nSir David Steel: To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment if he\nwill make a statement outlining the respective roles of his Department and\nthe new Environment Agency in implementing the landfall tax, with special\nreference to what new steps will be taken to prevent illegal dumping and fly\ntipping in the countryside, and to relieve landowners on whose property such\nwaste is deposited from liability to pay the tax when they transport it to\ndesignated landfill sites.\nMr. Gummer: My Department is responsible for the overall regulatory\nframework for waste management in England and Wales. Regulations\nimplemented on 1 May 1994 introduced a new waste management licensing\nsystem. The associated duty of care for waste came into force on 1 April\n1992. The penalties that can be imposed for offences relating to waste are\nalready severe, and these controls provide a strong regulatory framework to\nsupport the introduction of the landfill tax. My Department will also write\nto the courts before the start of the tax on 1 October 1996, to draw their\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n84 HM Customs & Excise press notice, Budget 1995: Landfill tax ..., 28 November 1995\n85 HC Deb 11.6.96 cc 114-115W\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nattention to the financial gains that can be made by those who dispose of\nwaste illegally.\nThe Environment Agency is the competent authority for the purposes of\nwaste management licensing. The agency has the resources and the expertise\nto advise on the legal and sound management of waste, to investigate\noffences and to carry out enforcement action. The Government's guidance\nto the agency on its objectives and contribution to sustainable development,\nwhich will be laid before Parliament very shortly, will clarify its role in this\narea. Ministers will expect the agency to act upon its powers and to review\nprocedures for preventing and handling cases of fly tipping. The\nGovernment have no plans to relieve the occupiers of land on which waste\nis deposited illegally from liability to pay landfill tax where they dispose of\nthe waste to licensed landfill sites.\nMost recently, when asked what steps would be taken to increase the penalties for fly-tipping\nfollowing the introduction of the tax, the government pointed out that the penalties were\nalready severe, and summarised the existing maximum penalties for waste related offences\nin a written answer. For the unlawful deposit or disposal of non-special or special waste,\nthese are imprisonment for six months and/or a fine of £20,000 following prosecution in the\nMagistrates' court, or imprisonment for two years and/or an unlimited fine in the Crown\ncourt86. \nC. Introduction of the tax \nIn his 1995 Budget speech, the Chancellor confirmed that the new tax would come into\noperation on 1 October 1996:87\nLast year I proposed a new landfill tax, which is a charge on the disposal\nof waste in, for example, tips and old quarries. That will come into effect\non 1 October 1996. It will be charged at a standard rate of £7 a tonne and\na lower rate of £2 for inactive waste. That is a tax on waste in order to\nenable me to reduce the tax on jobs. The money raised by the landfill tax\nwill allow for a matching cut in the main rate of employers' national\ninsurance contributions by a further 0.2 per cent to 10 per cent from April\n1997. That will cut the cost of employment by half a billion pounds and\nwill make it cheaper for businesses to create new jobs.\nLegislation to bring in the tax was included in the Finance Bill, introduced in January 1996.88\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n86 HC Deb 5.11.96 cc 459-60W\n87 HC Deb 28.11.95 cc 1063-1064\n88 It is now contained in sections 39-71 of the Finance Act 1996.\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nIn setting the rates of tax at £7 and £2 per tonne, the Government was keen to emphasize the\npurpose of the tax was not to severely curtail landfill use as such, let alone stop it. Rather,\nthe tax would help to align more closely the price charged for landfill, and the true costs of\nusing it. This point was illustrated well in an exchange during the proceedings of the Finance\nBill, between the then Paymaster General, David Heathcoat-Amory, and Dawn Primarolo\nMP:89\nI repeat the point that capturing those external costs, whether they be\npollution or a form of nuisance to residents and others, is an important\nconsideration. It will encourage the waste producers, whoever they may be,\nto look for ways to produce less waste and to reuse and recycle more waste\nif they cannot avoid producing it. We know that there is substantial scope\nfor businesses and others to adopt better waste management practices. The\ntax will give them a precise incentive to continue to do so.\nIn other words, what we are proposing will reinforce the existing policy of\nsustainable waste management, which was set out in considerable detail in\nthe White Paper published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for\nthe Environment last month. The concept in the White Paper was of a waste\nhierarchy, headed by waste minimisation. The most desirable aim must be\nnot to produce so much waste. Lower down the hierarchy is reusing waste.\nFurther down again comes the recovery of waste, which can include\nrecycling, composting and energy recovery from incineration. The hon.\nMember for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mrs. Jackson), who is no longer in her\nplace, was under the misapprehension that the landfill tax would somehow\nact as a disincentive or inhibition on composting. In fact, the reverse is the\ncase, as the hierarchy shows. If waste can be composted, it will avoid\nlandfill tax. At the bottom of the waste hierarchy is disposal, which includes\nlandfill.\nThe landfill tax will be an important means of moving waste up the\nhierarchy and away from landfill. The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms\nPrimarolo) said, bafflingly, that the tax would send a signal that landfill was\nthe most desirable means of disposal. That calls into question her\nunderstanding of the whole principle of the tax because the reverse is the\ncase. By taxing landfill, we are providing an incentive to move to other,\nmore environmentally benign means of dealing with waste.\nMs Primarolo: A study for the Department of the Environment undertaken\nby Coopers and Lybrand showed that with a levy on landfill even as high\nas £20 per tonne, recycling would still remain a relatively unattractive\nfinancial option and that the use of the tax alone would not be enough to\ndevelop alternatives. Therefore, essentially the Government are saying that\nlandfall is all right or that options that are worse than landfill but cheaper\nare also all right.\nMr. Heathcoat-Amory: The hon. Lady is now arguing for a much higher\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n89 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.167\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nrate of tax, which can only double the anxiety expressed by some of my\nhon. Friends. If she is suggesting that the modest tax we are proposing will\nnot boost recycling in the way that we wish, that is an argument for a higher\ncharge. We do not accept that. Although the tax will not overnight create\nvast quantities of recycled waste, that might be a good thing. By flooding\nthe market with recycled products we might kill the very process that we are\ntrying to promote. We believe that the tax rates of £2 and £7 will at least\nnudge the market towards a greater use of recycled materials and therefore\nmove waste generally up the hierarchy that I described earlier.\nAt separate stages in the Finance Bill's progress, it was suggested that it was unfair to\npenalise landfill sites that were well run, and that dealt just with entirely safe and innocuous\nmaterials. In reply, the then Paymaster General, David Heathcoat-Amory, made an important\npoint:90\nBy taxing landfill, we will encourage the development of alternative ways\nof dealing with waste. Indeed, it will lead to less waste in the first place.\nThat justification for the tax is valid even if the landfill site is well\nengineered ...\nThe tax is designed not only to tax waste with the potential to pollute water\nor air, but to catch the external costs associated with the landfilling or rubble\nwaste and all categories of inactive waste. Such activities are not without\nenvironmental impact. I am sure that some letters from my hon. Friends'\nconstituents, who live near landfill sites, reflect the problems cause by noise,\ndust, smell, seagulls and lorry movements. Those represent an external cost\nof landfilling even inactive or inert waste. The tax is designed to capture\nthose costs and to attribute them to the producer of the waste. The proposed\nlower rate of tax at £2 per tonne reflects the lower impact on the\nenvironment caused by that category of waste.\nDuring the proceedings of the Finance Bill in spring 1996, a variety of industries argued that\ncertain types of waste be exempted completely from the new tax, or covered by the lower £2\ninert charge.91 As it turned out, three types of waste were specified as exempt from tax:\ndredgings from waterways, natural waste from mines and quarries and waste from the\nreclamation of historically contaminated land. In March details of the types of waste to be\ncharged the lower £2 per tonne rate of tax were given:92\nMr. Matthew Banks: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what was the\noutcome of the Customs and Excise consultation exercise on the scope of\nthe lower rate of landfill tax.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n90 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.187; Standing Committee E 8.2.96 c.160\n91\n\"Arguments over the landfill tax get down to the nitty-gritty\", ENDS Report, January 1996 pp 20-23\n92 HC Deb 25.3.96 cc 439-440W\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nMr. Heathcoat-Amory: Customs and Excise have now analyzed the replies\nwhich they received to the consultation exercise on the scope of the lower\nrate of landfill tax. On the basis of the information provided and\nrepresentation made, we have concluded that the lower rate of landfill tax\nshould apply to the wastes listed. Mixtures consisting only of listed wastes\nwill qualify for the lower rate, as will water with suspended solids consisted\nonly of listed wastes.\nIn order to be taxable at the lower rate, listed wastes   or mixtures of such\nwastes   must not contain or be contaminated with any material which is not\nlisted. If they are, the standard rate of tax will apply. But a de minimis level\nwill apply to enable wastes to qualify for the lower rate if they consist\nwholly of listed wastes, apart from a small quantity of material which is not\nlisted, provided that the material does not lead to any potential for pollution.\nWhere wastes appear on the lower rate list and are also covered by an\nexemption, the exemption will apply.\n \nNaturally occurring rocks and soils, including:\nclay, sand, gravel, sandstone, limestone, crushed stone, china clay, clean building\nor demolition stone such as sandstone, limestone or slate, topsoil, peat, coal, silt\nand dredgings.\nCeramic or cemented materials\nGlass.\nCeramics, including bricks (see below for bricks with plaster), tiles, clay ware,\npottery, china, bricks and mortar.\nConcrete, including reinforced concrete, concrete blocks, breeze blocks and\nthermalite blocks.\nProcessed or prepared mineral materials, which have not been used or\ncontaminated\nMoulding sands and clays.\nClay absorbents, including Fuller's earth and bentonite and other mineral\nabsorbents.\nMan-made mineral fibres, including glass fibre.\nSilica.\nMica.\nAbrasives.\nFurnace slags\nCertain ash:\nBottom ash and fly ash from wood or coal combustion (including pulverised fuel\nash from coal combustion).\nLow activity inorganic compounds:\nTitanium dioxide.\nCalcium carbonate.\nMagnesium carbonate.\nMagnesium oxide.\nMagnesium hydroxide.\nFerric oxide.\nFerric hydroxide.\nAluminium oxide.\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nGypsum and plaster\nThese will be subject to the lower rate only if disposed of in landfall sites\nlicensed only to take inactive or inert waste.\nOther wastes\nThere are, in addition to the above, a few wastes on which Custom and Excise\nare seeking further information before a conclusion is reached as to whether the\nlower rate is appropriate.\nMixtures consisting of these wastes, it was explained, would qualify for the lower rate.\nMixtures that contained a small quantity of active waste - chargeable at the £7 rate - would\nstill qualify for the lower rate provided the mixture posed no risk of pollution.\nFor its part, the Institute of Wastes Management was sceptical of the value in charging the\ntax at an inert rate and an active rate:93\n[During the 1970s and 80s...] Inert waste as a term was suitably ambiguous for\noperators and regulators to use when disposing of builders rubble, construction waste,\nspoil, soil and other extraneous materials. Most of these materials were in fact\nanything but inert and contributed to leachate, landfill gas and settlement on old and\nnot so old landfill sites. The term became notorious, and quite rightly, went out of\nuse as the potential environmental harm from such wastes became more widely\nunderstood. \nFollowing details of the landfill tax announcement in November 1995, we now learn\nthat the lower rate of landfill tax will be levied on 'inactive' wastes which 'do not\nphysically or chemically react, biodegrade or adversely affect other matter with which\nit comes into contact in a way likely to give rise to environmental pollution'. Such\nwastes include naturally occurring rocks and subsoils, uncontaminated materials, glass,\nceramics and concrete.\nLeaving aside the relative 'inactivity' of these materials, a number of questions are\nraised by this. When in practice are these wastes delivered to a disposal facility\n(landfill) uncontaminated? Will a saving of £5 per tonne be a sufficient financial\nincentive for waste producers to ensure that their wastes are inactive and therefore\nqualify for the lower rate tax? Will the regulatory system be able to identify\nsatisfactorily that which is truly inactive and uncontaminated against the opposite?\nMore to the point, will the driving force behind such an inspection system be a\nfinancial one (higher or lower tax) or an environmental (inactive or active waste) one?\nDuring the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, the Labour Party suggested that a third tax\nrate of £15 could be levied on \"special waste\". The Government opposed this, on the grounds\nthat this category had not been defined, that hazardous waste was subject to tight controls as\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n93\n\"IWM Comment : Inert by any other name\", Wastes Management, February 1996 \n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nit was, and that the tax should be simple and easy to understand. In the event, the proposal\nwas rejected.94\nAt the time of the November 1995 Budget, Customs issued a compliance cost assessment on\nthe impact the new tax would have on business, focusing on those required to account for the\ntax to Customs (ie, those who run landfill sites). About 1,400 businesses will be required to\nregister with Customs, operating about 2,700 sites overall. The industry is dominated by\nsmall firms; the largest five companies in this sector, who each have a turnover in excess of\n£100 million, represent about 20 per cent of the market. For larger operators, it was thought\nstart up costs associated with the tax would be around £25,000 to £50,000; continuing\ncompliance costs might be around £4,000 per year. Estimates received from small firms put\nthe equivalent costs for this size of company at about £750 for initial costs. In relation to\ncompliance costs, Customs felt many small firms overestimated how much they would need\nto set aside (in reply, firms gave figures between £200 and £2,500+ per quarter, with an\naverage of £1,400). Firms were, it felt, giving large estimates for the costs of routine record\nkeeping and form filling, aggregating landfill costs with costs associated with Customs\ngenerally, and exaggerating the frequency of Customs' visits. \nAll told, Customs felt annual compliance costs for small firms would be toward the lower end\nof the estimates range (ie, in the region of £800 per year). The assessment concluded that\n\"given the extent to which the tax will fit in with existing practice\", implementing waste\nmanagement regulations and accounting for VAT to Customs, \"the cost of complying with\nthe tax should be very low.\" It went on to note that the two main policy alternatives to a tax\n- tighter regulation, or requiring the industry adopt alternative practices - \"would be against\nthe spirit of the Government's deregulation initiative and would be less economically efficient\nthan using a market-based approach.\"95\nConsultation has marked the history of the new tax. Initially it was proposed that company\ndirectors should be jointly and severally liable for any landfill tax due from their company.\nIn effect, directors would be personally liable for the tax. The use of this power - employed\nin the betting and gaming field - had been thought appropriate since landfill companies would\nhave few assets in cases of insolvency, and - certainly in relation to inactive waste - the tax\ncharge could represent a high percentage of the total value of any transaction.96 With a much\nhigher proportion of the tax at risk in such cases, the Government had thought making\ndirectors responsible would be a good solution, but following strong opposition, it withdrew\nthis provision.97 Moreover, in February, Customs emphasized that to begin with it would\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n94 Standing Committee E 8.2.96 c.171\n95 Compliance Cost Assessment - Landfill Tax CCA 6/95, November 1995 p.9, p.11\n96 In Committee David Heathcoat-Amory gave the example of a site charging £1 per tonne for inactive waste,\nso that the £2 tax charge represented 200% of the original charge: Standing Committee E 8.2.96 c.191\n97 ibid c.192\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\napply penalty rules for tax collection sympathetically:98\nThe Department will take a sympathetic view of genuine errors made as a result of\nunfamiliarity with or misunderstanding of the tax provision during its first year.\nHowever, Customs reserve the right to assess the duty properly due, when considering\nwhether to impose penalties and interest. Similar arrangements were made during the\nintroduction of insurance premium tax and air passenger duty. This means operators\nwill not be penalised for a first default in the first year, unless it was thought that\ndeliberate evasion or manipulation was involved.\nIn a pamphlet on environmental taxes published by the Institute for Public Policy Research,\nthe authors praised the long consultation process that had shaped the final design of the tax:99\nThe new landfill tax is a good model of how a tax ought to be introduced. It was\nannounced in 1994, details were announced in 1995 and, following extensive\nconsultation, it is being implemented in 1996. The consultation was genuine, and the\ndesign of the tax has been totally altered as a result (it will be based on weight rather\nthan being ad valorem as the Government originally proposed). This is a new\ndeparture, not only for environmental policy, but for British tax policy generally.\nAgain all political parties have supported it, as have all environmental groups. Even\nbusiness has not complained too much, although there has been some lobbying on\nwhat should constitute inert waste and so be liable for a lower rate.\nThe Government's goals for the new tax were restated by the Environment Minister, James\nClappison, in a press notice issued on the eve of its introduction:100\nThe landfill tax represents a significant new policy. The shift from taxing\nemployment to taxing resources has rightly been an aim of the EU but it is the UK\nthat is setting the pace. It marks an important step in extending the use of economic\ninstruments to achieve environmental objectives. The central purpose of the tax is to\nensure that landfill costs reflect the full cost of the environmental impact of the\nactivity. By doing this business and consumers are encouraged, in a cost effective\nand non-regulatory manner, to produce less waste, and to reuse or recover value from\nmore waste.\nOf course, the purpose of the tax as a revenue raising device should not be ignored. A\nwritten answer in April 1996 gave estimates for the amount of money the Government\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n98 HM Customs & Excise press notice, Landfill tax - Government meets industry concerns, 13 February 1996\n99 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green tax reform - pollution payments and labour tax cuts, Institute for\nPublic Policy Research, 1996 p.25\n100 HM Customs & Excise press notice, Less waste - more jobs, 30 September 1996\n36\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nexpects to collect:101\nMr. Sheerman: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what is the\ncurrent estimate of the revenue to be expected from the landfill tax;\n(2) what is his estimate of the revenue available for environmental trusts\nfrom the landfill tax;\nMr. Heathcoat-Amory: The estimated net revenue yield from landfill tax\nis £450 million in a full year. However, because precise figures about the\namount of waste sent to landfill are not available centrally, the revenue\nestimate for the tax is open to a greater than usual margin of error. The\nestimate assumes that credits of tax amounting to £50 million will be given\nto site operators in respect of voluntary contributions they make to\nenvironmental trusts, although, on the basis of the revenue projection for the\ntax and the maximum credit entitlement, as much as £100 million is\npotentially available for trusts in a full year.\nSome critics of the tax have suggested that the absence of precise figures on the amount of\nwaste going into landfill sites is telling, and that it is by no means certain that the new impost\nwill achieve any of the goals the Government has set for it.102 This question is examined in\nmore detail in the following section of this paper.\nIV What effects will the tax have?\nA. How much money will it raise?\nThe Government's position remains that the revenue from the tax will be around £450 million\nin a full year and around £110 million in the six months of its operation in 1996/97103. There\nhas never been any question, however, that these are extremely approximate figures. For two\nmajor reasons HM Customs & Excise will remain unsure of exactly how much will be\ncollected until the tax has been fully operative for a length of time.\nFirst, and of most significance, are the uncertainties concerning the amount of waste going\nto landfill. It was agreed in meetings between the Department of the Environment and HM\nCustoms & Excise that revenue forecasts would, of necessity, be based on the Department of\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n101 HC Deb 30.4.96 cc 436-437W\n102 See, for example, \"First green tax is 'a shot in the dark'\", Independent on Sunday, 29 September 1996\n103 HC Deb 31.10.96 c.775\n37\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nEnvironment's estimates of the amounts of waste landfilled in around 1990104. These\nestimates, summarised in section II, suggest that around 125 million tonnes of wastes eligible\nfor the tax are landfilled annually. In translating estimates of landfilled waste into estimates\nof tax revenue the Government have assumed that much of the 44 million tonnes of landfilled\nconstruction and demolition waste will be inactive and therefore charged at the lower rate of\n£2 per tonne, as will some of the 50 million tonnes of landfilled industrial waste. The vast\nmajority of household and commercial wastes will be active and liable to the higher rate of\n£7 per tonne105. \nThe basis of the revenue estimates is itself somewhat doubtful; the Department of the\nEnvironment accepts that106:\n\"much of the needed information [on waste management] is not readily available at\npresent, or is available with insufficient precision to enable reliable estimates ... to be\nmade\".\nIndeed, until the Landfill Tax is fully operative, accurate data on the amounts of waste going\nto landfill will remain unavailable. Consequently, HM Customs & Excise describe their\nrevenue forecasts as best estimates within a range of possibilities107. This is true even in\nterms of the uncertainties surrounding estimates of landfilling in 1990. There is also the\nadded complication of changes in the level of landfill in the subsequent six years. \nThere have been suggestions that the Government's estimates of the amount of waste going\nto landfill are outdated and may overstate the actual annual amount of landfilled waste by as\nmuch as 30 million tonnes108. Some limited data in this area are available for waste\n(household and commercial) collected by waste disposal authorities. Figures for the 50\nWDAs (around half of all WDAs) who reported their landfilling activities to CIPFA in both\n1992/93 and 1994/95 show a collective fall of around 10% in the amounts sent to landfill,\nfrom around 15.7 million tonnes to just over 14 million tonnes109. While these WDAs may\nnot be representative of all WDAs, and certainly the figures are in contrast to those for\nScotland (see page 10) which show an increase of 25% in the landfilling of all controlled\nwaste over a two year period, the figures suggest the possibility of a declining tax base.\nSecond, there is the question of behavioural changes in response to the imposition of the tax.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n104 source: HM Customs & Excise, 7 November 1996\n105 HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 1100-1101W\n106 Department of the Environment (DoE)/Welsh Office, Making waste work : a strategy for sustainable waste\nmanagement in England and Wales, Cm 3040 December 1995 p.17\n107 source: HM Customs & Excise, 7 November 1996\n108\n\"First Green Tax...\", Independent on Sunday, 29 September 1996\n109 CIPFA, Waste Disposal Statistics 1992-93, 1994-95 Actuals\n38\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nBecause, again, of the uncertainties surrounding landfill data, HM Customs & Excise have\nnot been able to incorporate an accurate estimate of the reduction in landfilling consequent\non the introduction of the tax into their revenue estimates. In practice110:\n\"the price elasticity of demand for landfill [will] depend on the suitability and\navailability of alternative waste management practices. This will vary to some extent\nacross the country and between different types of waste. It will also vary over time\nas the practices of waste producers and handlers change to reflect policies contained\nin the [Government's] waste strategy.\"\nToo little is known about each of these factors for any reliable projection of behavioural\nchanges to be made. Given, moreover, the unreliability of their basic revenue projection, HM\nCustoms & Excise believe that the introduction of a further complicating variable would be\nfruitless. In any case, the views of a number of commentators111 suggest that the behavioural\neffects of the tax are likely to be minimal in the short term at existing rates.\nB. What effect will the tax have on local authorities?\nThe concerns raised by local authorities during the consultation on the tax (summarised in\nsection III above) focused on the additional costs they will have to pay to landfill household\nwaste. The tax will be levied on the operators of landfill sites who, in turn are expected to\npass it on to their customers including local authorities. While local authorities will be able\nto recover the cost of landfilling commercial waste directly from their customers, the cost of\nlandfilling domestic waste will have to be met from their own resources. The Government\nargue that they have made provision for additional local authority expenditure in 1996/97\nthrough the local government financial settlement for this year112 and that the cost in future\nyears will be offset by the reduction in national insurance contributions113. Nevertheless, they\naccept that local authorities as a whole will spend more on the tax than they save through the\nreduction in contributions114.\nOnce again, estimates of the impact of the tax on local authorities are beset by the lack of\nknowledge on how much waste they landfill. As a whole the local authorities of England and\nWales have budgeted for £74 million of expenditure on the tax in 1996/97, and in a full year\nare expected to spend around twice this amount, £143 million115. This is slightly higher than\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n110 HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 1100-1101W\n111 See, for example, the views of the Environmental Services Association and the Friends of the Earth,\nsummarised at page 43\n112 HC Deb 29.2.96 cc 1099-1106\n113 HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 100-101W\n114 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.170\n115 CIPFA, Finance and General Statistics 1996-97; \"A waste of a tax?\", The Independent, 9 October 1996\n39\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nthe Government's estimate, based on the assumption that local authorities are continuing to\nlandfill around 18 million tonnes annually, almost all of which is active waste liable for the\n£7 rate of tax, of £126 million for local authorities across the UK116. The Association of\nMetropolitan Authorities suggest a figure of around £154 million117.\nThe cost to individual local authorities will depend upon their existing use of landfill and the\navailability of alternative management methods. The non-metropolitan authorities who,\nbecause of the availability of land, have tended to make greater use of landfill than their\nmetropolitan counterparts are likely to face particularly large bills. If authorities continue to\nlandfill to 1994/95 levels, the average cost for a non-metropolitan authority could be as much\n£1.7 million in a full year, compared with around £0.9 million for a metropolitan authority118.\nKent County Council, for example, may face a bill in the region of £5 million if they\ncontinue to landfill at a similar level as in 1994/95, when they landfilled some three-quarters\nof a million tonnes of household waste119. Surrey County Council have already estimated\ntheir likely full year expenditure at around £3 million120. In most cases, however, the non-\nmetropolitan authorities have a larger taxbase from which to finance their expenditure. \nIt has been suggested that this year's expenditure of £74 million in England and Wales has\nbeen met through cuts in other areas of local authority budgets121:\n\"A similar figure, £73 million, has been cut this year from councils' highway and\ntransportation budgets ... Philip Ramsdale, executive director of the Institute of Public\nFinance (the commercial arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and\nAccountancy), who oversaw the research, says that though linking the cuts to new\nenvironmental spending commitments is simplistic, it does give a reasonable\noverview. 'It may well be that this is not a conscious approach in individual\nauthorities, but in overall terms that seems to be what is happening', he says.\" \nFor 1997/8 the concern is that, in the absence of any compensatory grants from the\nGovernment, the full cost of the landfill tax, net of the offsetting reductions in national\ninsurance contributions, will have to be met through a combination of service reductions and\ncouncil tax increases. While it is accepted that local authorities will pay more in tax than\nthey will gain through the reduction in contributions, the precise net impact is not known.\nOn the basis of the figures produced by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, however,\nthe £154 million cost of the tax would be offset by a £60 million reduction in national\ninsurance contributions, leaving local authorities to find more than £90 million in a full year.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n116\n HC Deb 19.12.95 cc 1100-1101W\n117\n\"Landfill levy will raise council tax\", Daily Telegraph, 16 September 1996\n118 CIPFA, Waste Disposal Statistics 1994-95 Actuals\n119 CIPFA, op.cit.\n120\n \"A waste of a tax?\" The Independent, 9 October 1996\n121 ibid\n40\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nAssuming that the full burden is passed on to council taxpayers, this would be equivalent to\nan increase of around £5 for a band D taxpayer122.\nBeyond 1997/98, the burden on local authorities and council taxpayers will, of course, depend\nlargely on the extent to which local authorities are able to find alternative methods of waste\nmanagement. A further factor is the possibility of increases in the rate of the tax, a scenario\nwhich some commentators believe to be inevitable so long as the tax rate is below the level\nat which landfill becomes more expensive than alternative methods. Paul Ekin, of the\nindustrial forecasters Cambridge Econometrics, believes that the Government will\nprogressively increase the rate of the tax once it is established123. Tony Hammond, chairman\nof the local authority recycling advisory committee goes further, suggesting that:124\n\"Everybody is expecting the Chancellor to increase the amount of the landfill tax in\nthis year's Budget. Realistically, I think we can expect a Landfill Tax of £20 a ton\nwithin two or three years, whichever party is in power\".\nIf tax rates are indeed increased there is no guarantee that there will be further compensatory\ncuts in rates of national insurance contributions. The link made between contributions and\nthe tax in this year does not signify a permanent hypothecation of tax revenues, but was a\npresentational link; a future chancellor would not be obliged to put any additional tax\nrevenues into reducing contribution rates125. Local authorities are therefore likely to have to\nmeet the cost of any future increases in tax rates in full.\nC. What impact will the tax have on waste disposal?\nThe imposition of a landfill tax has been generally welcomed by environmentalists; it has\nbeen one of the obvious candidates for green taxation126. The announcement that the tax\nwould be weight-based was also welcomed. The alternative was an ad valorem tax (see page\n25), but this was opposed by environmental groups who feared that it would encourage\ndisposers to drive further, to cheaper less well-run sites. There is debate, however, about\nwhether the tax will have the desired effect and significantly reduce the amount of waste\ngoing to landfill:127\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n122\n Association of Metropolitan Authorities, cited in \"Landfill levy will raise council tax\", Daily Telegraph, 16\nSeptember 1996\n123\n\"Landfill tax only the start...\", Construction News, 10 October 1996\n124\n\"Landfill levy will raise council tax\", Daily Telegraph, 16 September 1996\n125 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green Tax Reform ..., Institute for Public Policy Research, 1996 p.76\n126 for example Stephen Smith, \"Greening\" the tax system in Britain and Germany, Institute for Fiscal Studies\nan Anglo-German Foundation Report, 1995\n127 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green tax reform - pollution payments and labour tax cuts, Institute for\nPublic Policy Research, 1996 p.94\n41\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\n\"The landfill tax is an important and welcome innovation, the first new tax introduced\nfor genuine environmental reasons in the UK. But it is deficient in three respects.\nFirst, it is too low, and is unlikely to alter significantly the amount of waste going to\nlandfill. The Government should have announced that the £7 rate was a first\ninstalment, and that there would be annual increases until the tax had a more\nsubstantial incentive effect. This would have sent a clear signal to waste producers,\nwithout inducing a sudden jump in their costs.\" \nThe same commentators call for a higher rate tax band for special waste and for a tax to be\napplied to all waste disposal, with perhaps incineration attracting a lower levy. \nPrior to the announcement of the rates of duty to be charged on landfill, the Institute for\nFiscal Studies was not hopeful that the tax would affect the amount of landfill significantly:128\nCrucially, the success of the policy relies on the government choosing an appropriate\ntax rate that adequately reflects the costs of landfill. In general, the social costs of\nlandfill will depend upon the nature of the waste. Inert waste such as building rubble\nwill result in little environmental degradation relative to toxic substances.\nExternalities will also vary with location of the landfill site. Waste deposited in urban\nlandfill sites need not be transported as far as waste generated in rural areas and so\nthe social costs of rural landfill generally tend to be higher than those of urban\nlandfill. Externalities associated with landfill without energy recovery129 have been\nestimated by the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment\n(CSERGE) as being around £3.50 per tonne in urban areas and £4.00 in rural areas,\nalthough these figures should be interpreted with caution since they do not include\nother significant impacts on the community such as noise, odour, unsightliness, etc.\nAlthough it would be appropriate for tax rates to capture differences in externalities,\nthis is likely to increase both administration and compliance costs. In view of this,\nthe Chancellor is expected to announce two rates, a lower one for inert waste and a\nhigher one for more environmentally damaging waste. It is likely that the higher rate\nwill be at least £4 per tonne if it is to reflect the external effects of landfill ...\nIn addition to increasing the tax burden on industry, the proposed levy will also have\na significant impact upon local authorities that are responsible for the collection and\ndisposal of all household waste and some commercial waste. IFS estimates for\nEngland suggest that local authorities' total waste disposal costs will increase by\napproximately £87m. Of this, around £40m will be paid purely on the collection of\ndomestic waste. Assuming that there will be no corresponding increase in grants from\ncentral to local government to help ease the burden of the levy, and that increases in\ncosts occurring from the collection of domestic waste will be purely borne by\nhouseholds and not businesses, then a tax of £5 per tonne will, on average, lead to an\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n128 Institute for Fiscal Studies, Options for 1996 : the Green Budget, October 1995 pp 88-89\n129 Some landfill sites have the facilities to recover methane from deposited waste.\n42\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nincrease in B and D council taxes of around £3.80 per year.\nBy itself, the landfill levy is unlikely to have a significant impact upon the amount\nof waste generated. Whilst the current system of charging for domestic refuse\ndisposal is incorporated into council tax bills, there will be no incentive for\nhouseholds to reduce waste. Consequently, if the government is to reach its target of\nstabilising the production of household waste at its 1995 level, it will be necessary to\nintroduce further measures.\nNor do environmental groups and the waste management industry appear certain that the tax\nwill significantly affect the reliance on landfill by those disposing of rubbish:130\nThe Environmental Services Association, the trade body which represents waste\ncollection companies, said yesterday that the tax would add to costs and push up\ncouncil tax bills. Friends of the Earth, however, said the tax was not high enough to\nachieve its objective of reducing the amount of rubbish dumped in landfill sites. 'It's\na small green step in the right direction. But it won't really work,' said FoE\ncampaigner Mike Childs. On this point the two sides agree. ESA chairman and chief\nexecutive, Peter Neill, said: 'I am sceptical whether isolated economic instruments will\nbe enough to encourage sustainable waste management.'\n... FoE cites a study for the Government by consultants Coopers & Lybrand which\nestimated that the current level of tax will increase recycling by only 1 per cent. It\nwants the tax set at a minimum £30 per tonne and it wants that sum also levied on\nincineration, to avoid the levy diverting waste from landfill sites to incinerators, which\nit believes are dangerous and do not encourage sustainability. The industry is\nconcerned that now the tax is in place, the sum could easily be increased by a hard-up\nChancellor, just like tax on booze or cigarettes. And it argues that a hefty landfill bill\nwill increase illegal fly-tipping. There is not even agreement on the greenest part of\nthe plan - the creation of Environmental Trusts, financed by up to 20 per cent of the\ntax revenues. Everyone agrees they are a good thing, but FoE worries that they will\nbe supervised by a regulator largely controlled by the industry ...\nWhile one view is that the levy could or should be progressively raised, another is that its\nusefulness may eventually wane, as landfill regulation and controls tighten. In their report\nfor the DoE, Coopers & Lybrand said that one of the reasons for introducing a landfill levy\nwas:131 \n\"...to cover the external (environmental) costs associated with landfill that are not fully\nreflected in the existing pricing structure - for example, landfills generate methane\nwhich contributes, inter alia, to global warming, leakage from decomposing waste can\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n130\n\"Green tax fails to please anyone\", Guardian, 1 October 1996\n131 Landfill costs and prices... , NS 8852 February 1993 p.3\n43\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\ndamage water courses and there may be disturbance costs from waste delivery and\nodour - insofar as ever tightening regulation of landfill operations will internalise\nthese costs, the justification for a levy may also diminish.\"\nCoopers & Lybrand argued that a levy would be unlikely to have any significant effect on\nthe amount of waste being landfilled in the short term132 and that incineration would be likely\nto remain an attractive option throughout England and Wales; recycling was expected to be\nrelatively unattractive even with a levy set at £20 per tonne. \nThe 1993 DoE report Externalities from Landfill and Incineration133 - which examined the\nenvironmental case for a levy - pointed out that the externalities associated with incineration\nand landfilling were fairly obvious (disamenity, litter, noise, smell, local disturbance, local\nand global pollution and transport effects) but difficult to express in monetary terms.\nNevertheless the report indicated that a levy in the range of £5-8 per tonne of controlled\nwaste landfilled would reflect the international benefit of air pollution displacement from\nenergy recovery; and £3-6 would be appropriate if only the UK benefit were taken into\naccount. Importantly, the report was not intended to estimate the size of a levy as such:\n\"Government may wish to bring various considerations other than the size of the externality\ninto the setting of a levy.\" \nAs mentioned above, Friends of the Earth have called for the landfill tax to be set at £30 per\ntonne and for incineration and other forms of waste disposal to be covered as well134. FoE\nScotland has described the landfill tax as a 'missed opportunity' which will have some\nnegative effects in making incineration more attractive; a waste tax on the other hand would\nhave encouraged recycling. FoE Scotland has also pointed out that with the different costs\nof landfill around the country, the charge might be little noticed in the South-East or London\nwhere landfill costs are already high, but could double the cost of landfill in Scotland.135 The\nchairman of the Recycling Advisory Group Scotland has called the landfill tax \"correct in\nprinciple but flawed in practice.\"136\nThe managing director of 3C Waste, one of Britain's largest waste management companies,\nhas called the landfill tax a 'disaster' which will raise disposal costs for all businesses and\nhouseholds and \"worse still, encourage fly-tipping in our hedgerows and on remote land and\nroadside verges.\" The tax is, he feels, not aimed at the real polluters who use unlicensed\nlandfill sites, falsify licenses or already dump rubbish illegally, and nor can alternatives, such\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n132 op.cit.\n133 CSERG Warren Spring Laboratory and EFTEL for the DoE, Externalities from landfill & incineration,\nDep.9876 1993\n134\n\"New tax won't dump but fails to fill recycling gap\", Guardian, 5 October 1996 \n135\n\"Landfill tax 'will act as catalyst'\", Herald, 29 November 1995 p.2\n136\n\"New landfill levy seen as burden on councils\", Scotsman, 29 November 1995\n44\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nas recycling, be developed quickly enough without real markets.137 \nOn the other hand, the managing director of UK Waste, the company which released the\nresults of its survey of landfill sites in 1994 (see page 19) has said the landfill tax will act as\n\"an important catalyst for waste minimisation, recovery, and recycling in the UK\" by\ndramatically raising the cost of waste disposal by landfill and giving waste producers a\nfinancial as well as environmental incentive to seek ways to reduce the amount of waste\nwhich they send to landfill.138\nThe Institute of Wastes Management has suggested that the landfill tax will be 'not very'\nsignificant: \"the majority of waste will still go to landfill and life as we know it will go on.\"\nThe reasons for this include the fact that some large companies have told landfill operators\nthat they do not intend to pay the increased landfill rates and are expecting operators to\nabsorb the tax if they want their business. If operators decline to do this, 'cowboys' will be\nwaiting to offer their services. The IWM says that with regard to recycling, 'many leading\nfigures' have predicted that it will provide very little spur. The point is also made that many\nincinerators are having to close at the moment because they do not meet modern emission\ncontrol standards.139 Indeed, in their report,140 Coopers & Lybrand pointed out that\nincineration capacity would not be great enough until the end of the decade to realise the\npotential switch from landfill to incineration.\nD. What role will environmental trusts have?\nThe 1993 Coopers & Lybrand report141 on landfill suggested that one possible although not\nattractive reason for a landfill levy could be to provide a clean up fund for managing later\nenvironmental difficulties which might arise. A system of Environmental Trusts was first\nsuggested in the landfill tax consultation paper142 as a means of providing tax rebates for\nlandfill operators making payments to trusts for specified environmental improvements. This\nwould reflect the environmental impact of landfill and further encourage the development of\nalternatives. The payments made will be limited to restoration of closed landfill sites (or\ndamage caused by such sites) when liability is unclear, research into and development of new\nwaste technologies, or pilot projects for waste minimisation, recycling, composting and energy\nrecovery. At the time of the November 1995 Budget, it was announced that site operators\nwould be able to claim a rebate of 90 per cent of their annual contributions, up to a maximum\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n137\n\"Landfill tax will be a disaster in Cheshire\", Wastes Management, August 1996 p.23 \n138\n\"Landfill tax 'will act as catalyst'\", Herald, 29 November 1995 p.2\n139\n\"IWM Comment: Taxing times, but for who?\", Wastes Management, September 1996 p.4\n140 DoE, Landfill costs and prices ..., NS 8852 February 1993 p.vi\n141 op.cit. p.2\n142 HM Customs and Excise, Landfill Tax: consultation paper, Dep/3 1341 21 March 1995 pp 11-12\n45\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nof 20 per cent of their landfill tax bill in any given year.143 The Secretary of State for the\nEnvironment, John Gummer, has said that the trusts will \"strengthen the environmental\ncredentials of the landfill tax\" and have the potential to generate up to about £100 million of\nprivate sector expenditure for environmental improvement.144\nA working group chaired by the DoE and including the waste management industry, other\nindustries that landfill their own waste, the CBI, environmental groups involved in waste\nmanagement and land remediation and local authority associations was established to decide how\nthe trusts would operate. The activities in which trusts may be able to become involved, subject\nto approval by the Government, include:\n    • research into, and development of, more sustainable waste\nmanagement practices and the provision of education, information\nand support for innovative projects (examples here might include\nresearch into new technology, pilot projects or training schemes\naimed at waste minimisation, re-use, recycling, composting and\nenergy recovery);\n     • collection and dissemination of information about waste management\nand more sustainable waste management practices;\n     • remediation, restoration and amenity improvement of sites which are\nnot able to support economic or social use due to past waste\nmanagement or other industrial activities (providing that no benefit\naccrues to a person who caused or knowingly permitted the\nenvironmental damage or is anyway liable for its remediation); and\n    • provision of environmental, amenity and recreational facilities in the\nvicinity of landfill sites, eg creation of habitats, wildlife and\nconservation areas.\nThe trusts will be non-profit distributing bodies within the private sector and when they were\nannounced it was made clear that HM Customs & Excise would approve a regulatory body\nto monitor the scheme's operation and audit the trusts' expenditure. This body, the\nEnvironmental Trust Regulatory Body Ltd, or Entrust, was launched in October 1996.145\nEntrust is a private sector body which will enrol environmental organisations as approved\nbodies to receive funding from landfill operators.

But Lord Cranbrook said that the executive's experience of the landfill\nindustry would be advantageous. 'We have to regulate and decide priorities in the\nenvironmental field. Many of these landfill operators do see themselves as working\nfor the environment,' he said. 'I am chairman of Shanks & McEwan's advisory board.\nIt has given me quite wide experience of the sort of things that might arise from\nlandfill sites. But we are quite separate from Shanks & McEwan.' \nFor its part, the Institute for Fiscal Studies was unenthusiastic about the prospective impact\nof environmental trusts, in its discussion of landfill tax published in its Green Budget in\nOctober 1995:148\nA second feature of the government's proposals is that landfill businesses are to\nreceive tax rebates on money they pay into environmental trusts, approved by\ngovernment, involved in the restoration of closed landfill sites or research and\ndevelopment into sustainable waste management practices. It is envisaged that rebates\non payments would never be more than 90%. This should ensure that firms will have\nan incentive to check that their payments are being used carefully. Although the\nwaste disposal industry has broadly welcomed the idea of environmental trusts, the\nmeasure can be interpreted as a move towards hypothecation, albeit under a different\nname, and over the long term, these rebates may also be a somewhat unsustainable\npractice. From an environmental perspective, the main purpose of the tax is to reduce\nthe amount of waste going to landfill, but at the same time the rebates are to be used\nto promote long-term objectives such as research and development and restoration of\nold landfill sites. However, it is expected that revenues from the tax should dwindle\nover time as firms adopt alternative measures for waste disposal, and so this will\nundoubtedly constrain the government's ability to fund future rebate payments.\nFurthermore, since it is essentially the private sector rather than government that will\nbe responsible for the trusts' activities, these new environmental expenditures will not\nappear in the public finances.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n147\n\"Industry links taint green tax\", Observer, 29 September 1996\n148 Options for 1996 : the Green Budget, October 1995 p.89\n47\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nE. The cut in National Insurance Contributions (NICs)\nWhen he announced the introduction of landfill tax in his 1995 Budget speech, Kenneth\nClarke proposed that the money raised by the new tax would be used to cut National\nInsurance Contributions (NICs): \"The money raised by the landfill tax will allow for a\nmatching cut in the main rate of employers' national insurance contributions by a further 0.2\nper cent to 10 per cent from April 1997. That will cut the cost of employment by half a\nbillion pounds and will make it cheaper for businesses to create new jobs.\"149\nThe authors of a recent pamphlet on environmental taxes published by the Institute for Public\nPolicy Research applauded the principle at stake in cutting NICs:150\nThe concept of a green tax reform is not nearly as widely debated in the UK as in\nmany other European countries, but it has been gaining support gradually in recent\nyears. Conservative Chancellor Kenneth Clarke signed up to the principle when he\nlinked the new landfill tax to a reduction in employers' National Insurance\nContributions, saying: \"I want to increase the tax on polluters, and make further cuts\nin the tax on jobs\". (The Treasury subsequently pointed out that this was not\nhypothecation but a presentational link - a future Chancellor is not obliged to put any\nextra revenues from the landfill tax into reducing NICS). However, the landfill tax\nraises a comparatively small amount of money, around half a million pounds a year,\nso the shift cannot be said to be significant, and the 1995 Budget contained no new\ntaxes on polluters ...\nSome concern has been expressed by trade unionists about the weakening of the\ncontributory principle if employers' National Insurance Contributions are reduced\n(although it is perhaps worth remembering that radical trade unions opposed the\nintroduction of National Insurance when Lloyd George proposed it in 1911, arguing\nthat benefits should be paid out of general taxation). The contributory principle is a\nfiction    National Insurance Contributions are not nearly large enough to cover what\nthey are supposed to fund. The notion that employers should take responsibility for\nsome aspects of their employees' well-being is a noble sentiment, and in an age of full\nemployment or labour scarcity would be worthy of strong support. Sadly, in an age\nof mass unemployment when public policy makers need in effect to induce employers\nto take on more workers, it appears something of a luxury. What matters to\nindividuals, in this context, is that they have a job and that there is a decent welfare\nsystem. The way in which the revenue is raised to finance the welfare system is\nsurely a second order concern, and it must be sensible to organise the tax system in\na way which maximises employment.\nIn any case, opposition to reductions in employers' NICs should not be taken as\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n149 HC Deb 28.11.95 cc 1063-1064\n150 Stephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham,  Green tax reform ...

Presumably, the\nuse of revenues from the landfill levy to reduce employment taxes is an application\nof the 'double dividend' arguments discussed earlier. However, this initiative must\nlargely be seen as cosmetic. Piecemeal changes are likely to have little impact overall\n(particularly since in this case even a tax rate of £5 per tonne, approximately 50% of\ncurrent average landfill prices, will only lead to small reductions in NICs). Indeed,\nthis measure raises the question of why the Chancellor has decided to use revenues\nfrom the landfill levy in this way when there would be much more scope to reduce\ndirect taxes by using the revenues from other 'green' tax measures such as petrol taxes\nor VAT on domestic fuel and heating. Furthermore, although reductions in NICs are\nlikely to be welcomed by industry across the board, the measure will not, in many\ninstances, be particularly beneficial to those industries likely to bear the largest burden\nresulting from the tax since many of these (particularly steel-making and electricity\ngeneration) tend to be capital-rather than labour-intensive.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n151 Options for 1996 : the Green Budget, October 1995 pp 88-89\n49\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nV Landfill abroad\nA.

It already exists in Denmark,\nthe Netherlands, France and parts of Belgium and I understand that the\nItalians are proposing to introduce such a tax. In general, the rates of those\ntaxes are above what we are proposing ... This is not an environmental\nEuropean tax. We have no desire to harmonise such tax rates throughout\nthe European Community. We are introducing it in this country because it\nsuits British conditions and it is good for the environment. Also, we can\nrelieve taxation on employment [by cutting the rate of employer's NICs].\nEach of the countries with a landfill tax already in force (Belgium, Denmark, France and the\nNetherlands) disposes of less than half of their municipal waste to landfill. Denmark has had\na landfill tax since 1986, which has increased from approximately £5 per tonne to a planned\n£33 per tonne in 1997. The Netherlands has a landfill tax of around £12 per tonne, and\nFrance a waste storage and industrial waste tax of £5154.\nIn Denmark particularly the introduction of a landfill tax, together with progressive increases\nin its rate, has coincided with a marked decline in levels of waste sent to landfill. In 1985,\nprior to the introduction of a tax, around 1.4 million tonnes of municipal waste, around 63%\nof all municipal waste, was landfilled by Danish municipalities155. In 1993, only around 0.5\nmillion tonnes of municipal waste went to landfill, around 20% of the total.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n152 Waste collected by municipalities. The figures in the table showing total waste generated are not a reliable\nindicator of absolute levels of waste generation, since the waste responsibilities of municipalities will differ\nbetween countries. The table does, however, offer a broad comparison of disposal routes.\n153 HC Deb 23.1.96 c.165\n154 Green tax reform..., Institute for Public Policy Research, 1996 p.30\n155 Eurostat, Environment Statistics 1989, Tables 9.2 and 9.4\n51\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nB. European developments in landfill legislation\nA draft Landfill Directive - 93/7506/EEC - was first proposed by the European Commission\nin 1990. The UK's main objection concerned its proposed ban on co-disposal.156 The\nGovernment was also concerned by the suggestion that all landfills should be routinely\nmonitored.157 Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg stated that they expected the\nDirective's conditions to, in effect, bar landfill without pre-treatment to ensure that stable\nresidues only were landfilled for 'long-term safety'.158 (The Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Pollution in its report Incineration of Waste159 recommended pretreatment of\nlandfill waste by incineration to reduce the long term risks of pollution, greenhouse gas\nproduction, risk of leaching, and volume of landfill by up to 90%.) \nIn their contribution to the Royal Commission's report, Aspinwall & Co commented on the\nlikely effect of the Landfill Directive:160\n\"The siting of a landfill site is already a complicated process but it is bound to\nbecome even more difficult in the future. The latest draft of the EC Landfill Directive\nproposes to include restrictions in terms of proximity (not less than 5000 metres) to\nroads, recreational areas, houses, waterways or agricultural sites. Clearly this doesn't\nleave much room for new development ... The UK tradition of refilling voidspace left\nby quarrying works may ease the impact of this new restriction, but in the long term\nthe consequence will be that landfills will become fewer, and subsequently more\nvaluable.\"\nIn May 1996 however, the European Parliament, on the recommendation of the Environment\nCommittee's rapporteur, rejected the common position on the draft Directive (445 votes to 18,\nwith 22 abstentions).161 MEPs felt that the Directive did not go far enough, in that it did not\nban an indefinite perpetuation of co-disposal. It also included the possibility of exempting\nsmall landfills in mountainous or sparsely populated areas from control. This had been\ninserted at the insistence of Ireland and Portugal and meant, said the rapporteur, that half the\nland area of the Community might possibly be excluded from the scope of the Directive.162\nBecause the Council of Ministers had adopted its common position by qualified majority\nrather than unanimity (France and Belgium wanted the Directive to go further) the\nParliament's vote effectively killed the Directive, as the rapporteur acknowledged, calling for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n156 Europe Environment, 14 June 1994 p.1\n157 Landfill of waste; European standing committee A 2 February 1994, HMSO\n158 ENDS Report, September 1994 p.18\n159 Cm 2181 May 1993\n160 op.cit.

The Commission's communication suggests that all waste\ngoing to landfill should be pre-treated. There is no sound scientific basis to this\napproach. Landfill when properly engineered and controlled is a viable waste\nmanagement option for a range of wastes.\nThe United Kingdom favours the disposal of untreated biodegradable waste to landfill,\nand the use of the biochemical process engineering - bio-reactor - approach to manage\nlandfill sites. This approach is designed to prevent pollution caused by the\ndegradation process, and to provide conditions in the landfill in which stabilisation of\nthe waste in situ is as rapid as possible. The approach is based on research into\nlandfill practices that the [DoE] has sponsored for more than 20 years.\" \nThe Commission is expected to publish a new proposal for a Directive 'in the next few\nweeks'. The UK has undertaken to oppose any provisions requiring the pre-treatment of all\nwaste going to landfill.166\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n163 UNEP/Inter-Parliamentary Union, Environmental Notes for Parliamentarians, June/July 1996\n164\n\"EC waste policy up in the air as MEPs reject landfill Directive\" ENDS Report 256, May 1996 pp 38-39\n165 HC Deb 16.10.96 cc 1060-1061W\n166 HL Deb 31.10.96 c.28WA\n53\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/103\nVI Further reading\nDepartment of the Environment, This Common Inheritance - Britain's environmental strategy,\nCm 1200 September 1990\nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Seventeenth report - Incineration of waste,\nCm 2181 May 1993\nDepartment of the Environment, Government response to the Seventeenth report..., July 1994\nDepartment of the Environment, Landfill costs and prices: correcting possible market\ndistortions, NS 8852 February 1993\nDepartment of the Environment, Externalities from landfill & incineration, Dep.9876 1993\nDepartment of the Environment, Economic instruments and recovery of resources from waste,\nDep.8701 1993\n\"Environmental taxes\" in Institute for Fiscal Studies, Options for 1996 : the Green Budget\nOctober 1995 pp 81-90\nDepartment of the Environment, Making waste work : a strategy for sustainable waste\nmanagement in England and Wales, Cm 3040 December 1995\nHM Customs & Excise, Landfill tax - a consultation paper, March 1995\nHM Customs & Excise, Landfill tax - report on responses received to consultation paper,\nSeptember 1995 \nHM Customs & Excise press notice, Budget 1995: Landfill tax - using market forces to help\nthe environment, 28 November 1995 \nHM Customs & Excise, Compliance cost assessment - Landfill tax CCA 6/95, November 1995\nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Nineteenth Report - Sustainable Use of Soil\nCm 3165 February 1996\nStephen Tindale & Gerald Holtham, Green tax reform - pollution payments and labour tax\ncuts, Institute for Public Policy Research, 1996\nEnvironment Agency, Landfill restoration and post-closure management - consultation draft,\nWaste management paper 26E August 1996\nHM Customs & Excise press notice, Less waste - more jobs, 30 September 1996\n54\n\n\n\n"],"description_s":["Landfill.

This paper presents up-to-date\nunemployment rates not published elsewhere. These use figures for the number of unemployed\nclaimants from the monthly count and figures for the number of people economically active\nderived from the 1991 Census of Population. \nThese residence-based rates should be regarded more as a social measure of relative\ndeprivation than as an economic measure of the mismatch between the supply of and demand\nfor labour, as they take no account of people's ability to seek work outside the constituency\nin which they live. For a full exposition of the methodology used to calculate these rates, see\nthe Research Paper 96/63.\nThe data contained in this Paper are generally not comparable with figures published in this\nseries of Papers of this series prior to May 1996. This is because in May 1996 the ONS\nchanged the geographical basis of the monthly claimant count. Previously, the monthly\nfigures have related to parliamentary constituencies defined in terms of frozen 1981 wards.\nFrom the April 1996 figures onwards, data are based on constituencies defined in terms of\nfrozen 1991 wards. Whilst figures for January, February and March 1996 were re-released\non the new basis, back-runs of figures for dates prior to 1996 will not be published. For\nmany constituencies therefore, there will be a discontinuity in the figures at the end of 1995.\nFor this reason it is no longer possible to produce tables showing the change in the number\nof claimants 1 year, 3 years and 5 years ago. \nNotes to tables:\n1. The political parties shown against each constituency are as they stand currently. The\nfollowing abbreviations for parties have been used:\nCON Conservative UUP Ulster Unionist Party\nLAB Labour DUP Democratic Unionist Party\nLD Liberal Democrat SDLP Social Democratic and\nPC Plaid Cymru Labour Party\nSNP Scottish National Party UPUP Ulster Popular Unionist Party\nSPKR Speaker UKU United Kingdom Unionist\nVAC Vacant seat\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/105\n2. The data from the 1991 Census of Population used for the denominators in calculating\nresidence-based unemployment rates were obtained from the dataset known as the\nLocal Base Statistics. In the case of the Censuses for England and Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland, the raw data relate to areas known as \"Enumeration Districts\".\nThese data are first aggregated into electoral wards and then wards are aggregated to\nform constituency totals. In Scotland the raw data relate to \"Output Areas\". These\nfigures are not available at a ward level but are aggregated directly into higher level\ngeographical areas such as constituencies and districts.\nThere is inevitably a time-lag between changes in electoral ward boundaries being\nincorporated into parliamentary constituencies. This means that wards are not always\ncoterminous with constituencies. Where this is the case, wards have been best-fitted\nto constituencies on the basis of the constituency where the majority of the population\nare thought to live.

The Social Security Administration\n(Fraud) Bill was presented on 15 November 1996 and is due to be debated on Second\nReading on 25 November 1996.\nBenefit fraud is currently estimated to cost the taxpayer £3 billion a year. Various initiatives\nhave been introduced to detect and prevent fraud; the in-year detection target for 1996/97 is\n£1.8 billion.1 The Government has stated that the first aim of this Bill is 'to ensure that fraud\ninvestigators have the tools they need to catch those who cheat the benefit system and to\nensure that fraudsters pay'.2 The Bill will:\n remove barriers to comparing information held on different databases for the purpose of\npreventing, detecting and investigating fraud;\n introduce a range of penalties for claimants who give false information to get benefit;\n ensure that those who conceal information, as well as those who make false statements, can\nbe effectively prosecuted;\n make it easier to prosecute people who make fraudulent attempts to get a National\nInsurance number.\nThe second stated aim of the Bill is to improve local authorities' performance in the\nadministration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. In this area the Bill will:\n enable the establishment of an inspectorate to monitor anti-fraud work in housing and\ncouncil tax benefits which are administered by local authorities;\n introduce powers to make directions to local authorities to improve their performance in\ntackling housing benefit fraud.\nParts II and III of this paper give general background on benefit fraud (housing benefit fraud\nis dealt with separately); part III sets out the Bill's provisions in detail and includes comment\nfrom interested organisations.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 DSS Fraud Bill - Background Briefing for Queens Speech, 23 October 1996\n2 ibid\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nII Social Security fraud in general\nA. The extent of fraud and anti-fraud initiatives\nThe extent of social security fraud is estimated to be around £4 billion in the current year, of\nwhich around £1 billion is detected.3\nResearch carried out by the Benefits Agency suggests fraudulent claims of income\nsupport/unemployment benefit, housing and council tax benefits account for the bulk of fraud\nactivity. Evidence from surveys suggests around £1.5 billion is being overpaid in income\nsupport and unemployment benefit (often associated with failure to declare income, capital\nor changes in status such as living together as husband and wife).4 A further £1 billion is\nreckoned to be being overpaid in housing benefit.5\nIn July 1995 the Secretary of State for Social Security announced a five-year strategy to give\nmore emphasis to the prevention and deterrence of fraud and error. This aims to increase the\nsecurity of the benefit process by:\n increasing control at the point of entry to the benefit system;\n improving control throughout the life of benefit claims;\n improving security and control at the point of benefit payment; and\n minimising weaknesses in the design of benefits.\nIn 1995/6 detected fraud savings amounted to £1.4 billion. £716 million in benefit fraud was\nstopped by over 400,000 investigations and £507 million was saved through initiatives such\nas data matching, bar-coding and scanning of order books, extra visits and checks on new and\nexisting claims. Benefit fraud stopped by local authorities accounts for the remaining\n£222 million.6\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 Financial memorandum to the Bill\n4 BA Security Benefit Review (Income Support & Unemployment Benefit) June 1995\n5 DSS press notice Jan 1996, \"Billion Pounds Housing Benefit Fraud Revealed\"\n6 DSS press notice, Fraud savings hit new high, 5 August 1996\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nThe categories and details of detected fraud savings are:\n1994/5\n£m\n1995/6\n£m\nIndividual benefit fraud 599 638\nMultiple identity fraud 6 11\nMethod of payment fraud* 68 55\nOrganised method of payment fraud*,\nsecurity control programme savings\n(eg new claims visits, data matching,\nbar-coding of order books) 24 507\nBenefit savings by local authorities 171 222\nTotal 889 1,444\nCriminal prosecutions 9,546 10,677\nArrest in Organised Fraud 1,336 1,207\n     * Savings from stopped method of payment fraud are now recorded under the\nSecurity and Control Programme savings.\nProjects implemented in the first year of the strategy to reduce weakness and risks in the\nbenefit system include:\n New claim visits.

Types of fraud\nBenefit fraud occurs in four main areas:\n Misrepresentation of household circumstances - either through incorrectly notifying the\nBA at the point of claim or failing to notify during the period of the claim.\n Misrepresentation of financial circumstances - either through incorrectly notifying the\nBA at the point of claim or failing to notify during the period of the claim.\n Identity - where claimants are not who they say they are and are not in fact entitled.\n Security of payments - When instruments of payment (order books and girocheques) are\nstolen, manipulated or counterfeited to obtain payments to which there is no entitlement.\nAccording to the Benefits Agency, fraud investigation work suggests the great majority of\nfraud occurs through misrepresentation of household or financial circumstances.8\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Benefits Agency Security Strategy, Five Year Programme Against Fraud and Abuse \n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nIII Housing Benefit/Council Tax Benefit \nA. The extent of fraud\nExpenditure on Housing Benefit (HB) has doubled in real terms since 1988; projected\nexpenditure for 1996/97 is £11 billion.

The report11 estimated that the total annual\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n9 Social Security Departmental Report Cm 3213 March 1996 , Social Security Departmental Report Cm 2813 March\n1995, DSS The Growth of Social Security 1993\n10 Social Security Select Committee, Housing Benefit Fraud, 1 May 1996 HC 90-I 1995-96 para 20\n11 Housing Benefit Review - Main Stage Report\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nvalue of HB lost as a result of error or fraud could exceed £1 billion; of this total it was\nestimated that fraud would account for over £900 million. The Social Security Select\nCommittee's report, Housing Benefit Fraud, which was published in May 1996,12 is critical\nof this estimate because of the methodology employed by the DSS:13\n'Much more serious than the failure to detect these individual frauds is the Report's almost complete absence\nof evidence on organised or collusive frauds, particularly landlord fraud. This absence of evidence can be\npartly explained by the passive nature of the exercise, based on checking existing information rather than on\ninvestigation. The difference between checking information and investigating fraud is fundamental but the\nawareness of this difference is not widely understood, let alone acted upon. The Committee has been told that\nif investigative techniques are used a high level of fraud is detected in the private rented sector.'\nThe Committee concluded that the true total of HB fraud could possibly be as high as £2\nbillion14 but the Government has rejected this suggestion:15\n'The Housing Benefit Review was a carefully planned, statistically sound study which involved unannounced\nvisits to claimants in their homes by trained fraud investigators. Its design was endorsed by the National Audit\nOffice. The Review estimated the scale of Housing Benefit fraud to be of the order of £1 billion. No other\nstudy has ever been carried out in this country with a similarly rigorous methodology. The Government is\nsceptical, therefore, about the view of the Local Authority Investigation Officers Group expressed to the\nCommittee that Housing Benefit fraud could amount to £2 billion, and notes that no supporting evidence was\nprovided for it.'\nOn 14 November 1996 the Audit Commission published an update to its report Protecting the\nPublic Purse: Ensuring Probity in Local Government16 in which it states that '[housing]\nbenefit fraud continues to be the major probity issue facing local government.'17 It found that\nthere were 162,000 proven fraudulent cases in 1995/96 involving losses of £55 million; this\nrepresented over 5 times as many detections as there were five years before.\nFollowing the Government's announcement of its intention to bring forward a Bill to combat\nsocial security fraud during the Queen's Speech on 23 October 1996, the London Housing\nUnit (LHU) issued a Press Release in which it laid the blame for the increase in HB fraud at\nthe Government's feet:18\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 HC 90-I 1995-96\n13 ibid para 49\n14 ibid para 6\n15 Housing Benefit Fraud: Reply by the Government to the Third Report from the Social Security Select Committee\nSession 1995-96 Cm 3299 June 1996 para 6\n16 The first Audit Commission report of this title was published in 1993.\n17 para 12\n18 LHU press notice, Government policy leads to benefit fraud, 25 October 1996\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n'The high level of rents has made fraud a much more lucrative proposition for unscrupulous private landlords.\nThey were able to make claims for housing benefit for tenants who did not exist and for dwellings that were\nunoccupied.\nLettings in the private sector were far more vulnerable to fraud than those in the public sector ... In the case\nof council housing, the local authority is able to check immediately from its other records who is occupying\na property. According to LHU research, the cost of housing benefit to the Exchequer is now running at four\ntimes the level it was in 1988, the last year before private sector rents were deregulated by the Government. \nLHU analysis shows that barely one pound in every four of this increase [in housing benefit expenditure] is\ndue to a rise in the number of privately rented properties for which housing benefit is paid. The great bulk\nof the increase comes purely from an increase in rents.'\nB. Types of fraud\nStudies into HB fraud have noted that it can be committed in a variety of different ways; the\nlist below, taken from the Social Security Select Committee's report,19 illustrates the many\nways in which HB fraud can be perpetrated:\nProperty based fraud:\nResidence:\n claimant not resident at given address\n failure to report change of address\n claimant only resident long enough to set up claim (this may involve redirection of mail)\n sub-letting and moving on\nRent/tenancy:\n overstating rent payable (either individually by the tenant or collusive inflation of rent so\nlandlord and tenant split the proceeds\n fictitious sub-tenancy\n landlord is fictitious\n home owner is purporting to be tenant (at own home or another address)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n19 HC 90-I 1995-96 para 52\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n landlord is a close relative\nMultiple:\n claims for benefit by claimant using multiple identities\n claims for benefit by claimant using multiple addresses\nLandlord:\n fictitious tenancy (claim for benefit where no tenancy exists)\n confirmation by landlord that tenant still in residence even though he has moved out\n claims for empty properties\n abuse of right to buy scheme with the property being bought then setting up tenancies with\noriginal tenants as private tenants\nAgents:\n agents with no legal standing (ie not authorised by the owner) increaseing rent levels or\nnumber of tenants\nLarge scale organised fraud:\n of various types including where a business or family own a number of properties and\nmove 'tenants' in and out with such regularity that tracing becomes impossible.

Anti-fraud initiatives\nHB has been administered by local authorities on behalf of the DSS since 1983. As with all\nbenefits, an important objective of the delivery system is to ensure that all those entitled to\na benefit receive the correct amount; local authorities have a statutory responsibility to ensure\nthat their systems do their best to meet this objective. The Social Security Select Committee's\n1996 report commented that: 'During the 1980s there appears to have been little coherent\nstrategy to prevent, deter or detect Housing Benefit fraud'.20 In practice, until 1993 the\nsubsidy system in operation penalised authorities for detecting fraud as these payments were\ntreated as overpayments which attracted a lower rate of subsidy. Recent years have seen\nconcerted efforts by central and local government to combat fraud.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n20 ibid para 30\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n1. Financial incentives\nBy way of an incentive to authorities to be vigilant in regard to potentially fraudulent claims\nthe DSS introduced a scheme in April 1993 whereby authorities could share in any savings\nachieved above and beyond their share of a national baseline (originally set at £100 million\nand increased to £150 million from April 1996).21 These incentives were strengthened in\nApril 199622 so that authorities can now receive 10 per cent additional subsidy on savings\nabove three quarters of their share of the national threshold and 25 per cent (previously 20\nper cent) on savings achieved in excess of their share of the national threshold. The threshold\nis distributed according to each local authority's share of national HB/Council Tax Benefit\n(CTB) expenditure.\nIn April 1994 subsidy reductions were introduced for authorities achieving less than 50 per\ncent of the £100 million threshold in order to encourage those who were perceived as doing\nlittle to combat fraud. In 1993/94 local authorities saved around £90 million; this increased\nto £171 million in 1994/95 and £222 million in 1995/96. In the last financial year around 90\nper cent of authorities (421) received bonus payments as a direct result of their efforts to curb\nfraud;23 a total of £28 million in extra subsidy was earned in 1995/96 as a result of the\nincentive scheme.24\nThe introduction of the incentive scheme was generally welcomed by local authorities. In\nJanuary 1995 the DSS published an analysis of the operation of the scheme25 the main\nfindings of which are summarised in the Social Security Committee's Report as follows:26\n the proportion of authorities with no fraud staff in place had decreased from 28 per cent\nto four per cent since the implementation of the scheme in April 1993;\n 80 per cent of local authorities expected to better their performance in the second year of\nthe scheme compared to the first year;\n the majority of authorities (77 per cent) agreed that in dividing up the national baseline,\nthe level of benefit expenditure should be used while a similar proportion (79 per cent)\nthought that such data should be weighted to reflect factors that varied between authorities;\n there was evidence of different methods being used to calculate benefit savings;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n21 This initiative was referred to as 'Action Against Fraud'.\n22 Following the publication of the Housing Benefit Review - Main Stage Report.\n23 DSS press notice, DSS cracks down on organised fraud by London landlords, 15 May 1996\n24 HC Deb 12 November 1996 c.195W\n25 Local Authority Anti-Fraud Incentives\n26 HC 90-1 1995-96 para 32\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n there was widespread agreement that the formula took no account of preventive or deterrent\nwork.\n2. National register\nFollowing publication of the Housing Benefit Review in January 1996 the Secretary of State\nfor Social Security, Peter Lilley, announced the creation of a national register of Housing\nBenefit and Council Tax Benefit (to be operational from July 1996) with a view to matching\ndata across local authorities against departmental fraud detection systems:27\n'There are currently 475 local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland. They administer Housing Benefit and\nCouncil Tax Benefit individually on different, unconnected IT systems with no interface with Benefits Agency\nIT systems. The Central Register will provide comparison of information, detection of inconsistencies and\nidentification of fraud. It will be able to match data within and across local authorities and against DSS systems\nto detect fraud and inconsistencies.'\n3. Challenge funding\nThis initiative, also announced in response to the Housing Benefit Review - Main Stage\nReport, has involved making up to £10 million available from April 1996 'to enable local\nauthorities to develop innovative ideas to tackle fraud'.28 Authorities may bid for funds with\nwhich to implement new schemes; successful schemes are to be publicised to encourage\nadoption by other authorities. The finance for this scheme has been re-directed from local\nauthorities' administration grants.\n4. Audit Commission\nIn January 1996 the Secretary of State announced that the Government intended to work\nclosely with the Audit Commission to tighten up local authority methods of preventing\nfraudulent claims getting into the system.29 \nThe Audit Commission's auditors have been working with local government in London to\ndevelop computer techniques for detecting fraud. Its 1996 report30 notes that the London\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n27 DSS press notice, Billion pound benefit fraud revealed, 19 January 1996\n28 ibid \n29 ibid\n30 Protecting the Public Purse: Ensuring Probity in Local Government, 14 November 1996 para 13\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nTeam Against Fraud detected fraud worth £3 million using these techniques in 1995/96; by\n1997 it aims to extend these techniques to all councils in England and Wales as part of the\nNational Fraud Initiative (NFI). \nThe Commission is carrying out a joint study into HB with the National Audit Office (NAO)\nwhich is designed to review the arrangements to deter, identify and investigate fraud. The\nNAO is to report to Parliament on the effectiveness of the DSS's measures to encourage local\nauthorities to combat fraud, including subsidy incentives and anti-fraud training. The\nCommission intends to publish a report and handbook describing best practice, aimed at those\nin local government who administer HB.31\nThe Audit Commission is also participating in a joint study with the Benefits Agency on co-\noperation between the Agency and local authorities in preventing and detecting fraud. The\nCommission is involved in the formation of the London Organised Fraud Investigation (see\nbelow).\n5. Fraud teams\nAs concern about HB fraud grew during the 1990s a number of local authorities developed\nsome local initiatives. In 1993 the Finance Directors of London Boroughs formed the London\nCommittee for Action Against Fraud which funds the London Team Against Fraud. In 1994\nthis Team set up a Housing Benefit Central Register to match HB data across 33 London\nBoroughs. In 1991 local authority fraud investigators formed a national group, the Local\nAuthority Investigation Officers Group. A separate group, the London Boroughs Fraud\nInvestigators Group was formed in London. The aim of these groups is to raise the profile\nof local authority fraud issues and provide training and support to their members.\nIn May 1996 the Social Security Fraud Minister, Oliver Heald, announced the creation of the\nLondon Fraud Investigation Team (LOFIT) comprising six specialist teams of up to 20 local\nauthority investigation officers. LOFIT is to focus on:32\n organised HB fraud conducted across more than one London borough;\n liaison with the Benefits Agency, Police, Crown Prosecution Service, London Team\nAgainst Fraud and other relevant organisations;\n landlord surveillance;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n31 ibid\n32 DSS press notice, DSS cracks down on organised fraud by London landlords, 15 May 1996\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n promotion of good practice in preventing and detecting fraud.\n6. Response to the Social Security Select Committee's Report\nIn response to the Committee's May 1996 report Peter Lilley announced three new anti-fraud\nmeasures including:33\n The setting up of a cross-governmental committee to formalise the co-ordination of\nmeasures to tackle fraud;\n The relaxation of restrictions on the sharing of information between the Inland Revenue\nand DSS officials for the purpose of identifying potential fraud;\n Discussions to take place with the Royal Mail over access to the database of redirected\nmail to assist in tackling multiple identity and other frauds involving false addresses.\nIII The Bill and detailed comment\nA. Supply and use of information (Clauses 1-4)\nThe general aim of these clauses (1-4) is to improve the detection of certain types of benefit\nfraud by allowing data provided to certain government departments to be compared with data\nheld by the DSS in order to identify inconsistencies. Local authorities will be allowed to\nexchange and pass on data to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud and to promote\nthe efficient administration of HB and council tax benefit (CTB).\nProvisions for the exchange of information between government departments for social\nsecurity purposes are currently covered by section 122 of the Social Security Administration\nAct 1992 and section 116 of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.\nThese relate solely to information held by the Inland Revenue. They state that any obligation\nof secrecy on the part of the Inland Revenue cannot prevent the disclosure of information held\nin connection with the assessment or collection of income tax to officials of the DSS. The\ninformation must be in connection with the collection and assessment of national insurance\ncontributions. Once information is disclosed to the DSS, the department is as bound as the\nInland Revenue not to disclose that information further, unless it is to be made available for\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n33 DSS press notice, New Ministerial anti-fraud group announced in response to Social Security Select Committee\nReport, 5 June 1996\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nthe purposes of civil or criminal proceedings in relation to contribution law, the Jobseekers\nAct 1995 or the determination of a question by the Secretary of State.\nThere is currently no provision to enable information held by Customs and Excise to be\ndisclosed to the DSS. However, as the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise are\nauthorised to disclose to each other information which is relevant to the other's duties it has\nbeen suggested that some information which is passed to the DSS by the Inland Revenue\ncould have originated from Customs and Excise34.\nFor self employed people paying schedule D tax, the information that can be disclosed to the\nDSS is restricted to that which is sufficient to identify the person undertaking the work,\ndetails of when that person commences or ceases self employed work and to certain\ncircumstances when the responsibility for the assessment of Class 4 contributions has passed\nfrom the Inland Revenue to the DSS.\nThe department has been developing its investigative methods for detecting fraud with an\nincreased use of information technology. The Generalised Matching Service (GMS) has been\nin operation since April 1995. It takes benefit data from internal Benefit Agency computers\nand matches that information against specific rules to identify inconsistencies. In this way\nthe system generates referrals for fraud officers to investigate and according to department\nfigures has led to £29m in savings in 1995/635. There have also been attempts to extend the\nworking cooperation between government departments with regard to the disclosure of\ninformation36.\nClause 1 of the Bill will replace section 122 of the 1992 Act and proposes to extend the\nprovision for the disclosure of information. The Bill stipulates that information held by the\nInland Revenue and Customs and Excise may be passed to the DSS:\n'for use in the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences relating to\nsocial security;\nor\nfor use in checking the accuracy of information.'\nThis is more directive than the 1992 Act which merely states that the passing of certain\ninformation cannot be prevented. Under the Bill's proposals as long as it can be used for the\nabove, there are no restrictions on the information which can be disclosed. \n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n34 Tolley's, National Insurance Contributions, 1996-7 p.348\n35 DSS press notice, Fraud savings hit new high, 5 August 1996\n36 Inland Revenue press notice 94/137, 1 September 1994, DSS press notice 95/118, 19 September 1995\n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nThe new Section 122(3)(c) will allow for information passed on from the Inland Revenue and\nCustoms and Excise to be disclosed further to local authorities for the purpose of detecting\nand preventing council tax benefit or housing benefit fraud. The calculation of CTB and HB\nis partly dependent on the level of social security benefits to which a claimant is entitled.\nThe new Section 122A will allow information held by the Inland Revenue to be disclosed to\nthe Contributions Agency and re-enacts existing provisions. The Contributions Agency is the\narm of the DSS which maintains and checks people's National Insurance contribution records.\nHowever, unlike information passed from the Inland Revenue to the DSS, it was not thought\nnecessary to allow for this to be disclosed further to local authorities and this is not provided\nfor.\nClause 2 extends the provisions to include information held by people working for other\nGovernment departments. Subsection (1)(a) covers information which relates to \"passports,\nimmigration and emigration, nationality or prisoners\" and would allow for this to be given to\nthe DSS for the same purposes as outlined for Inland Revenue information above. A\nclaimant's immigration status and nationality can affect their entitlement to benefits as this can\nbe dependent on residence or immigration-status. The Bill would allow DSS officials to\ncheck the information received from a claimant with that held about them by the immigration\nauthorities.\nConcern about prisoners stems largely from people failing to inform the authorities when they\nhave gone into custody and their claim for benefits has fraudulently continued. This issue\nwas raised in a parliamentary question in 1994 and Alistair Burt, then Parliamentary Under\nSecretary of State for Social Security, outlined the measures that were being newly undertaken\nat that time to combat this type of fraud:37\nIn response to the continuing problem of benefit fraud amongst prisoners new controls were introduced on 4\nMarch. The Prison Service now provides the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service with a weekly\nlist of all newly convicted prisoners in England and Wales. This will ensure that all benefit recipients have\ntheir case reviewed on entry to prison.\nThe provisions in the Bill would extend these controls to cover all prisoners including those\non remand.\nSubsection (b) covers information which relates to \"any other matter prescribed\". This\neffectively means regulations could be laid which would allow for any Government\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n37 HC Deb 16 March 1994 c.709W\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\ndepartment to be covered by these provisions. The definition of Government departments for\nthe purposes of this Bill is:\n'a person providing services to a Minister of the Crown or a government department\n(including a Northern Ireland department)'\nThus, anyone who comes under this definition could in the future come under the terms of\nthe Bill and be required to pass information to the DSS which could assist in preventing or\ndetecting benefit fraud. This information could then be disclosed further to local authorities\nto help with the detection of CTB or HB. Similar provisions are included in the Bill to cover\nthe use of other government information in Northern Ireland to be made available to the DSS.\nThe Government believes the new rules will remove unnecessary barriers to the effective\ndetection and prevention of social security fraud.\nWhilst recognising the need to ensure benefit fraud is tackled effectively some respondents\nto the Bill feel that the increased powers it would provide need to be balanced by safeguards\nto protect people's privacy. Justice, a campaign group for human rights and legal reform,\nbelieve the Data Protection Act would provide inadequate protection and advocates a\nstatutory code of practice relating to data matching between government departments.\nClause 3 adds a new section (122C) to the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to allow\nthe Secretary of State or the Northern Ireland (NI) Department to supply information relating\nto HB or CTB to local authorities for use in the administration of those benefits and requires\nauthorities to have regard to this information when administering them. \nAs clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill provide for the supply of information held by tax authorities\nand other government departments to the Secretary of State or the NI Department, the effect\nof clause 3 is to enable this information to be supplied to local authorities for use in the\nprevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences relating to HB or CTB, or to\ncheck the accuracy of information relating to HB/CTB claims. \nThe clause allows the Secretary of State or NI Department to impose conditions on the use\nof such information and to charge a fee for supplying it. Further disclosure of the information\nis to be prevented except in certain limited circumstances.\nAdditionally, clause 3 inserts a new section (122D) into the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary\nof State or NI Department to require local authorities, and other bodies authorised to exercise\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nthe HB/CTB functions of an authority, to supply information relating to benefit administration\nor policy to the Secretary of State or NI Department. The manner and form of information\nsupplied under this section may be prescribed.\nClause 3 also inserts a new section (122E) into the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary of State\nand NI Department to authorise local authorities to supply information relating to benefit\nadministration to other authorities for use in the prevention, detection, investigation or\nprosecution of offences relating to HB/CTB or for maintaining and improving the accuracy\nof information relating to those benefits.\nClause 4 extends the provisions in Schedule 4 to the 1992 Act that set out who may commit\nthe offence of unauthorised disclosure of social security information to cover local authority\nmembers, officers and employees, local authority contractors and their employees, local\nauthority inspectors and local government ombudsmen and auditors.\nB. Administration of HB and CTB (Clauses 5-10)\nClause 5 inserts a new section (139A) in the 1992 Act to enable the Secretary of State to\nauthorise persons to consider and report to him on the administration of HB and CTB by local\nauthorities with particular reference to the prevention and detection of fraud. These\n'authorised persons' will have rights of access, at any reasonable time, to any documents and\ninformation relating to the administration of benefits. They will also be entitled to an\nexplanation from any person accountable for documents, or involved in benefits\nadministration, and to require it to be given in person. Any person who fails, without\nreasonable excuse, to comply with such a requirement imposed by an authorised person will\nbe guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on\nthe standard scale(£1,000).\nA report to the Secretary of State made under this section by an authorised person may\ninclude recommendations about improvements that could be made by an authority in terms\nof benefit administration, with particular regard to the prevention and detection of fraud.\nLocal authorities will receive copies of these reports as and when they are sent to the\nSecretary of State.\nThe effect of clause 5 will be to give power to a national inspectorate to monitor anti-fraud\nwork by local authorities. An inspectorate could be set up under existing social security\nlegislation but it would lack the powers that the Bill is seeking to introduce. \n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nThe local authority associations have questioned the need for such an inspectorate on the\ngrounds that only 27 out of 400 authorities were below their fraud targets in 1995/96; Paul\nLautman of the Association of District Councils (ADC) has been reported as stating:38\n'It's using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, the DSS has already got sufficient means to penalise poor\nperformance. We would have thought there were better ways to invest than in a costly inspectorate.'\nThe associations are concerned about what they perceive as the 'big brother' approach of\ndeveloping an inspectorate with extensive powers; Paul Lautman has commented that local\nauthorities are responsible bodies and that the rationale for a fraud inspectorate is none too\nclear.39 Speaking on behalf of the joint associations Paul Jenks, Chair of the ADC Housing\nCommittee, stated:40\n'Local authorities share the Government's concern about benefit fraud and have made great efforts to tackle\nit. But we are concerned that the powers of this new fraud inspectorate are excessive and unnecessary - the\nmoney would be better spent recruiting local authority fraud investigators to work at the sharp end to combat\nfraud and to ensure that benefit reaches those who are entitled to receive it.'\nClause 6 inserts a new section into the Local Government and Finance Act 1982 to enable\nthe Audit Commission to assist the Secretary of State, on request, in any study designed to\nimprove the administration of HB/CTB by local authorities. Under this provision authorities\nand their officers will be obliged to provide information needed for the conduct of such a\nstudy. The clause also provides for the exchange of information between the Secretary of\nState and the Audit Commission.\nClause 7 makes similar provision in relation to the Commission for Local Authority Accounts\nin Scotland.\nClause 8 inserts a new section into the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (139D) to\nenable the Secretary of State to invite a local authority to consider a report made about its\nadministration of HB or CTB and to remedy any failing identified in it. The clause allows\nthe Secretary of State to make directions about the standards which an authority is expected\nto attain and the time within which they are to be attained. The Secretary of State will have\nthe power to make recommendations about the courses of action that the authority might take\nto achieve these standards.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n38\n\"Government hit squads set to raid LA benefit departments\", Housing Today, 31 October 1996 \n39 ibid\n40 ADC press notice, Local authorities need more resources to tackle fraudsters, say associations, 15 November 1996\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nClause 9 amends section 140B of the 1992 Act, which provides for the calculation of\nsubsidy in respect of HB and CTB, to strengthen the Secretary of State's powers to increase\nor decrease the subsidy paid to local authorities on the basis of their success or failure in\npreventing and detecting fraud. The manner in which these deductions/increases are to be\ncalculated will be specified by Order. The Secretary of State will also be able to deduct\nsubsidy if an authority fails to reach the standards that he has directed them to attain under\nsection 139D (see clause 8).\nThe local authority associations argued against the introduction of an increased detection\ntarget for HB/CTB fraud and associated subsidy cuts from April 1 1996.41 There was concern\nthat many councils would find it difficult to achieve the fraud savings targets set; Paul\nLautman of the ADC has made the following response:42\n'The DSS needs to recognise the need to invest to save. That means up front investment in investigating\nofficers. Councils have already expressed concern that the harsher incentive regime will throw their budgets\ninto turmoil.'\nThe local authority associations are, therefore, opposed to this provision in the Bill which\nimplies further adjustments in subsidy entitlement. They have called for councils to be given\n'a period of stability', and have said that the government is 'tinkering' without waiting to see\nhow far this year's targets are working.43\nClause 10 inserts a new section 110 into the 1992 Act to allow local authorities administering\nHB/CTB to appoint inspectors from among their employees or, with the consent of the\nSecretary of State, the employees of another authority or, from among employees of a\ncontractor acting on its behalf. An appointed inspector will be able to enter business premises\nto make enquiries about any person believed to be a benefit claimant or recipient. Private\ndwelling houses will not be liable to inspection unless there are reasonable grounds for\nbelieving that a trade or business is being carried on from there which is not also being\ncarried on from premises other than the dwelling house in question. The clause places a duty\non the following classes of person to supply information or produce documents if required by\nan appointed inspector:\n(a) persons who occupy premises liable to inspection or persons found by an inspector in\nany such premises;\n(b) persons believed by an inspector to be benefit claimants or benefit recipients;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n41 See page 16\n42\n\"Incentives to tackle fraud come under fire\", Inside Housing, 26 January 1996 \n43\n\"Councils fear moving fraud targets will hit cash incentives\", Inside Housing, 1 November 1996\n25\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n(c) persons believed by an inspector to hold or have access to information or documents\nrelating to a person in (b) above; or\n(d) persons who are employees or agents of a person within any of the paragraphs (a) to\n(c) above.\nIn regard to clauses 8, 9 and 10 CHAR, the housing campaign for single people, has made\nthe following response:44\n If increasing amounts of time and resources are directed towards tackling fraud then the\nefficiency of of other aspects of the HB system, eg calculation and payment of HB, are\nlikely to suffer. We fear that late payments could result, causing problems for claimants\nand landlords.\n If financial penalties and incentives are to be used to encourage local authorities to tackle\nfraud then we feel similar arrangements should be made to make them tackle the problem\nof late payments of benefit.\n We are concerned that the subsidy penalties could also cause over-zealous and cash-\nstrapped local authorities to victimise innocent people.\n If local authorities are constantly on the look out for fraud the culture of suspicion that\ncould arise in benefit offices could lead to large delays in the processing of HB claims and\nclaimants being subjected to excessive scrutiny prior to their being paid their HB.\nC. Offences, penalties and overpayments (Clauses 11-14)\nCurrently, a person attempting to obtain benefit45 is guilty of an offence if he:\n makes a statement or representation which he knows to be false;\n provides documents or information which he knows to be false;\n knowingly causes or allows another person to provide documents or information which he\nknows to be false.46\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n44 CHAR's response to the government's Fraud Bill, 15 November 1996\n45 Benefits covered by S.110 of the SSAA 1992\n46 Section 112 Social Security Administration Act 1992\n26\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nSuch an offence carries a maximum fine of £5,000 (level 5 on the standard scale), or\nimprisonment for up to 3 months, or both. In addition, a person may have to repay any\nbenefit overpaid as a result. This offence is liable for summary conviction only - this means\nit can be tried only in a magistrates  court (in Scotland, a Sheriffs  court).\nClause 11 creates a new, more serious, offence, where a person dishonestly makes a false\nstatement or provides false information or causes another person to do this to gain benefit or\nother advantage under social security legislation. It also makes an offence of failure to notify,\nor causing another person to fail to notify, certain changes of circumstances. These changes\nwill be prescribed in regulations.\nSuch an offence will be triable either summarily (in a magistrates  court) or on indictment\n(in a higher court). A summary conviction can have a fine of up to the statutory maximum,\n(currently £5,000) or imprisonment up to six months, or both. On conviction on indictment,\nthe maximum term of imprisonment is seven years, or a fine, or both.\nThis offence is intended to cover more serious fraudulent offences than the existing section\n112. In England and Wales it will require a person to have acted “dishonestly”, not just\n“knowingly”. In Scotland it will be sufficient for a person to have knowingly made\nrepresentations to obtain benefit for an offence under the new section to have been committed.\nThe reason for the different wording in England and Wales compared with Scotland is\napparently to allow for differences in the two jurisdictions and the DSS intention is that they\nshould have the same effect.\nClause 12 extends the summary offence of obtaining benefit by false representation. A\nperson who makes a statement or representation which he knows to be false is guilty of an\noffence. The clause strengthens this provision and a person who without \"reasonable excuse\"\nfails to report a change of circumstances or causes or allows another person to do so will be\nguilty of an offence. This means that it will be an offence to fail to notify a change in\ncircumstances or knowingly cause or allow another person to do so. The changes in\ncircumstances covered by this provision will be contained in regulations. \nWhere overpayment of benefit has occurred, generally, a person has to have misrepresented\nor failed to disclose a material fact for repayment to be required.47 Failure to disclose a fact\nwould include not telling the Benefits Agency of relevant changes in circumstances. There\nis currently no specific offence of failing to notify a change in circumstances - generally the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n47 Section 71(1) SSAA 1992 \n27\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nBenefits Agency relies on the wider failure to disclose and sometimes on the\nmisrepresentation provisions to encompass such individuals. Prosecutions of those suspected\nof benefit fraud are used in a very small proportion of cases. While court action is rare, in\nmany cases action the Benefits Agency attempts to recover money overpaid as benefits. This\ncan be done by stopping payment of the same or most other benefits or by enforcement\nproceedings in the county courts. Where recovery is through stopping Income Support, the\nmaximum which can be deducted from weekly benefit is £9.60 if a person has admitted fraud\nor been found guilty of fraud or £7.20 in any other case.\nClause 13 provides for a 30% penalty payment to be made in addition to an overpayment as\nan alternative to court action. This will apply to overpayments of centrally administered\nbenefits and housing and council tax benefit. The imposition of a penalty payment will only\nbe allowed where it appears that the overpayment is attributable to an act or omission on the\npart of an individual and there are grounds for instituting proceedings for an offence in\nrelation to the overpayment. Following written notice by the Secretary of State a person can\nagree to pay the penalty in the same way as overpayments are recouped. No proceedings\nrelating to the overpayment will be instituted against a person agreeing to pay the 30%\npenalty.\nAccording to the DSS, the rate of penalty needs to reflect a level that is high enough to be\nseen as punitive without being set too high so as to provide a disincentive to accepting the\npenalty. The level chosen is comparable to fines imposed by other government departments\nwhen the differing client groups are taken into consideration.\nEstimates accompanying the Bill reckon there will be around 25,000 overpayment penalty\ncases each year of which 5,000 will involve local authorities. For the DSS extra costs are\nestimated at around £3 million per year with anticipated savings of £3.9 million. For local\nauthorities the extra costs will be around £800,000 with up to £1 million collected in\npenalties.\nClause 14 amends section 75 of the 1992 Act, which provides for the recovery of\noverpayments of HB, to allow local authorities to recover HB overpayments from payments\nmade directly to a landlord or his agent in respect of other tenants where, for example, the\noriginal tenant, in respect of whom the overpayment arose, has vacated the landlord's property.\nPayments subject to a deduction in this way will still discharge the liability of the other tenant\nto the landlord. \nWhere overpayments are not recovered by deductions from benefits the clause provides for\ntheir recovery by action in the county court in England and Wales and in the sheriff's court\nin Scotland. This measure will align HB with other social security benefits by allowing a HB\n28\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\noverpayment determination to be treated as a proof of debt which can then be registered as\na court order.\nThe local authority associations have welcomed this extension to their powers to recover\nbenefit overpayments but are disappointed that the Bill will not go further to require the\nregistration of landlords owning more than 20 homes in respect of which HB is payable, and\nto allow the refusal of HB payments where they are not allowed to inspect properties.48\nSpecific measures that the associations would like to see introduced include:49\n a requirement on letting agents to give local councils the name of an owner of a property;\n a power to cease a claim if refused entry to a property;\n a requirement for a register of all landlords who own more than 20 properties.\nThe London Housing Unit, which believes that the main cause of the growth in HB fraud is\nthe ability of private landlords to make uncontrolled rent increases,50 has urged the\nGovernment to put more emphasis on the targeting of these landlords.51\nThe Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) is concerned that landlords will have\nno automatic right of appeal over the recovery of benefit in this manner and has issued the\nfollowing response to clause 14:52\n'Such arbitrary, tribunal-style justice will cause respectable landlords and their agents to turn away all Housing\nBenefit tenants and leave the housing of such tenants to the unscrupulous who often offer the poorest quality\naccommodation.\nThis will help to defeat the government's avowed intention of enlisting the private rented sector to make up\nthe shortfall in housing association and local authority housing.'\nCHAR, the housing campaign for single people, is of the view that clause 14 could exacerbate\nproblems which already occur where overpayments of benefit are recovered from landlords\nwho cannot recover the money from the tenants concerned because they have moved on.\nCHAR's response to the Bill makes the following points:53\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n48 ibid\n49 ADC press notice, Local authorities need more resources to tackle fraudsters, 15 November 1996\n50 See pages 11-12\n51\n\"Government told to re-route fraud investigations\", Housing Today, 31 October 1996\n52 ARLA press notice, ARLA reaction to DSS Fraud Bill, 18 November 1996\n53 CHAR's response to the Government's Fraud Bill\n29\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\n Many accommodation providers could find themselves with cash-flow problems if their\nrental income was reduced. Those most likely to suffer are small housing associations, the\nmany hostels with few resources, and private sector landlords who rely on rent to pay the\nmortgage on the property they rent out.\n Other tenants whose HB is being used to make up the overpayment could be affected.\nAlthough this is not the government's intention, it is possible that landlords will still expect\nother tenants to cover their rents - failure to do so could result in harassment or the\neventual loss of their deposit when they leave the property.\n The widespread discrimination against claimants in the private rented sector will be\nexacerbated by this part of the Bill. One of the major reasons for the current bias is that\nHB problems, ie shortfalls and delayed payments, lead the majority of landlords to seek\nto let to those in work. This change will provide another deterrent to letting to people on\nbenefits. It is particularly worrying as it will have the greatest effect on those landlords\nwho have more than one tenant on benefit.\nD. Reviews and medical examinations (Clauses 15-16)\nDisability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance are benefits available to severely\ndisabled people. The present benefit structure dates back to April 1992 when mobility and\nattendance allowances for people under 65 were replaced by DLA. This is one benefit with\nseparate components for care and mobility. Attendance allowance remains to meet the care\nneeds of those 65 and over. Currently, awards of DLA and attendance allowance can be\nmade for a limited period (with a minimum of 6 months) or for life. Recipients of\nDLA/attendance allowance can apply for their awards to be reviewed and it could be\nadvantageous for them to do so if, for example, their condition has worsened to the extent\nthey would be entitled to a higher rate. An adjudication officer can initiate a review of a case\nwhere there has been ignorance of a material fact, or a mistake, or a change in circumstances.\nDisability working allowance is a tax-free benefit to top-up the earnings of low-paid workers\nwith a disability. Like family credit, it is paid for 26 weeks, usually regardless of changes\nin circumstances.\nClause 15 enables the Secretary of State to initiate a review of these benefits and carry out\ninvestigations to obtain information for that review. It confirms that the Secretary of State\nmay initiate a review of benefit during the course of the current benefit award. The need to\nclarify the law on this point arises because existing provisions allow benefit reviews to be\n30\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\ninitiated \"on an application\". It has been questioned who can make such an application.54\nThis clause makes it clear that, in addition to the claimant, the Secretary of State can review\nbenefit entitlement during the course of an award and that he can undertake investigations to\nobtain evidence to support such a review.\nThese provisions are estimated to cost about £1 million annually, but lead to savings of\naround £3 million.55\nClause 16 gives regulatory powers to the Secretary of State to require existing recipients of\ndisability living allowance and attendance allowance to undergo a medical examination. It\nalso provides for payment of benefit to be withheld if a person fails to attend a medical\nexamination. If benefit entitlement is subsequently confirmed, the clause further allows for\nany withheld benefit to be paid.\nCurrently such powers only exist when an initial claim is being determined.56 Where an\naward has already been made and it is alleged that the person should not or no longer be\nentitled to benefit there is no power to require a person to undergo a medical examination.\nThe clause enables regulations to provide such powers.\nSchedule 1 para 2 amends the Social Security Administration Act so that a referral for a\nmedical examination is no longer for the person who applied for review, but for the person\nin respect of whom the review is being made. If the amendment were not made the\nimplication is that applications for review made by the Secretary of State would require him,\nrather than the benefit claimant, to attend a medical examination.\nThe Disability Alliance have expressed concern that these changes are being made in the\nabsence of any hard evidence of the existence of widespread fraud of either DLA or\nAttendance Allowance. They also believe that existing powers are sufficient to deal with\ncases of fraud and the extension of the powers proposed in the bill could lead to \"fishing\"\nexercises where there is no existing evidence of fraud. The Alliance also believes that the\nregulatory powers given to the Secretary of State in respect of medical examinations should\nbe more clearly defined, particularly they should only be applied where there is evidence of\na change in circumstances.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n54 For example, in Disability Rights Bulletin Summer 1996 \"Disability Living Allowance and Benefits Agency\nInvestigations\"\n55 Financial Memorandum to the Bill\n56 S.54 SSAA 1992\n31\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nE. National insurance numbers (Clause 17)\nA national insurance (NI) number is generally allocated to a person in the year preceding their\n16th birthday and marks the registration of that person within the state social security system.\nPeople who have never been given a number can apply to their local social security office\nwith documentary evidence of their identity such as a passport, EC identity card or Home\nOffice standard acknowledgement letter.\nNI numbers are also used as reference numbers in the national computerised PAYE system\nand the Inland Revenue has transferred names, addresses, dates of birth and titles of\ncontributors from the DSS computer.\n \nThe original purpose of the NI number was to record an individual's contributions but with\nthe increased computerisation of the benefits system, they have become more important in\nmaking claims for social security benefit. However, it is not currently essential to have a NI\nnumber to claim benefits. Legally claimants can receive benefit if they fulfil the conditions\nof entitlement. These vary from benefit to benefit, but possession of a NI number is not one\nof them. However, the Secretary of State (or the officer acting in this capacity) will need\ninformation and evidence in order to ensure that the claimant does satisfy the conditions. In\nparticular he or she will need to be satisfied that the claimant is who they say they are. For\nmost benefits, including income support, the computer systems have a field for the NI\nnumber, so that the claim could not be processed on the computer without this information.\nHowever, provided the officer is satisfied about the claimant's identity, the claim can be\nprocessed clerically. For example, where a claimant needed to apply for a NI number, the\nBenefits Agency office could assist them with this, and also process their income support\nclaim.\nThere has been concern expressed over the past few years about the number of NI numbers\nin circulation and the use of false numbers to perpetuate benefit fraud57. In response to this,\nthe Contributions Agency (the executive agency of the DSS which deals with NI numbers and\nrecords of contributions) is preparing for the introduction of a new recording system which\nis due to be operational by 1997. Staff who allocate NI numbers have also been receiving\nextra training to combat fraudulent applications for NI numbers.58\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n57 Social Security Select Committee Fifth Report, The Work of the Department of Social Security and its Agencies,\n1 November 1995 para 16\n58 Department of Social Security Press Notice, Fraud Savings Hit New High, 5 August 1996\n32\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nGeneral conditions for entitlement to benefit (as opposed to specific conditions for individual\nbenefits) are covered by the Social Security Administration Act 1992, Section 1, and the Bill\ncontains provisions to supplement these.\nClause 17 of the Bill proposes adding to the general conditions for entitlement to benefit by\nmaking it a condition that a claimant, and anybody on whose behalf a claim is being made,\neither has a national insurance number or has the evidence to enable him/her to be allocated\nwith one.\nSection (1B) will require that in order to become entitled to any benefit a claim must be\naccompanied either by:\n a national insurance number and evidence that the number has been allocated to that\nperson; or\n information which will enable the claimant's number to be ascertained.\nIf a claimant does not have a national insurance number they will need to apply for one with\nthe necessary evidence before they can become entitled to benefit. Those without national\ninsurance numbers will usually be those from abroad but people whose parents did not claim\nchild benefit and who have not worked may also come into this category.\nThe evidence required to prove a NI number belongs to the claimant currently depends on the\ncircumstances of the case and will vary according to the DSS officer's view of each case.\nItems which may be required to confirm a NI number, according to the DSS, include wage\nslips, medical certificates and passports. There is a form to apply for a new NI number and\nofficers may ask for a passport to confirm a person's identity. Providing false information for\nthese purposes will be an offence. These procedures will not be altered by the proposals in\nthe Bill but they will become a condition of entitlement to benefit. Concern has been\nexpressed that this amounts to a method of immigration control and this combined with the\nprovisions for exchange of information between Government departments contained in the Bill\nis likely to fuel this concern.59\nSection (1C) allows for regulations to be made which can exempt these provisions from\ncertain benefits, people or \"in other prescribed circumstances.\"\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n59 Child Poverty Action Group, Ethnic Minorities Handbook, 1st Edition, p.104\n33\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nAccording to the Financial memorandum to the Bill, the estimated annual cost of these\nprovisions is £50, 000 but the savings they will produce are \"difficult to quantify\".\nF. Redirection of post and Data Matching (Clauses 18-19)\nThe issue of claimants arranging for their mail to be redirected to enable them to perpetuate\na fraudulent claim was raised by the Social Security Select Committee.60 The Committee was\ninformed that requests from local authorities that mail be returned if it was marked 'Please do\nnot redirect' were ignored by the Post Office. A Post Office memorandum to the committee\nexplained that they were resisting such requests because there were a number of operational\nand commercial implications.61\nIn order to obtain information from the Post Office's address database, DSS and local\nauthority staff must currently apply on a case by case basis showing they have good cause\nto suspect an individual of fraudulent activity.\nClause 18 inserts new sections 182A to the 1992 Act, and 158A to the 1992 Northern Ireland\nAct. These would require social security and local authority mail which would otherwise be\nredirected, to be returned to the sender. Section 182A(2) will allow reasonable payments to\nbe made to the distributor of mail for this service.\nSection 182A(6) makes an exemption for mail which is under a court order to be redirected\nto the trustees of somebody who has been declared bankrupt. Payments issued are redirected\nto trustees to enable them to use the money to repay debtors. \nClause 19 inserts new sections 182(B) to the 1992 Act and 158(B) to the 1992 Northern\nIreland Act. It would enable staff of the DSS and local authorities to have access to the Post\nOffice database which details information of people who have paid for their mail to be\nredirected. This would remove the need to apply on a case by case basis and would enable\nofficers to cross reference people who appear both on their own databases and the Post\nOffice's. They will then be able to investigate why these people are having their mail\nforwarded and if it is being done as part of fraudulent activity. Section 182(B)(4) will allow\nreasonable payments to be made to the Post Office for this service.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n60 Social Security Select Committee Third Report, Housing Benefit Fraud, 1 May 1996 HC90-1 1995-6 para 80\n61 ibid para 82\n34\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nSections 182(B)(5) would prevent the further disclosure of this information to non\nGovernment departments unless it is to be supplied for the purposes of any civil or criminal\nproceedings relating to the Social Security Administration Act 1992, the Contributions and\nBenefit Act or the Jobseekers Act 1995 (or corresponding Northern Ireland legislation). \nSection 182(B)(6) would allow the further disclosure of information to other Government\ndepartments, such as the Inland Revenue and the Home Office, if it has been used to alter\ndetails which may affect that department's dealings with the individual concerned.\nJonathan Bamford, assistant registrar to the Data Protection Registrar, has recently expressed\nconcern that unless data matching techniques are supported by skilled human intervention and\nadequate safeguards, they may result in \"unwanted consequences for innocent individuals\n[which] may undermine the value of such activities\".62\nIn their response to the Bill, the Post Office have highlighted concerns about how both the\nmeasures will affect them as the major distributor of social security and local authority mail.\nWhile they are committed to the fight against benefit fraud, they feel the bill has been\nprepared too hastily and the lack of consultation with the postal service may result in\nproblems with the practical implementation of the measures. They argue these problems\ncould damage the reputation of the Royal Mail. The issues raised by the Post Office are:\n The fact that mail is marked 'do not redirect' will highlight the fact that it may include a\npayment and this has implications for the secure return of such mail. \n it will be practically difficult to distinguish mail redirected to trustees of people who are\nbankrupt and this could result in the Royal Mail failing to comply with a court order.\n innocent individuals who have paid for their mail to be redirected may suffer as a result\nof both measures.\n the reputation of the Royal Mail could be tarnished if they are seen as part of mechanisms\nto disclose personal information to other Government departments.\n the cost implications for the postal service to change operational procedures and how the\ndepartment will evaluate the level of \"reasonable costs\" to finance these changes.\nThe DSS and the Post Office are currently in the early stages of discussions on how these\nmeasures will work in practice and the costs involved. In the financial memorandum to the\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n62\n\"A match made in data\", Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation Supplement, 4 October 1996\n35\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/107\nBill, the DSS have estimated the cost of preventing redirection of mail at £250,000 which\nwould result in savings in the region of £1 million. The annual running costs for accessing\nthe postal redirection database are estimated at £400,000 per year leading to annual savings\nin the region of £2.2 million.\nG.

In\nthe three months ended August 1996, the main growth in exports (in value terms) has come from exports\nto EU, with the largest rise being in exports to Germany. This was partially offset by a fall in exports\nto Belgium. Outside the EU, rises in exports to Oil Exporting Countries and the Rest of the World\ncontrasted with falls in exports to other Western Europe, North America and Other OECD Countries.\nIn value terms the main growth in imports has come from North America and Germany. In 1995 the\nenlarged European Union (EU 15) received 58.3% of UK exports and supplied 56.6% of all UK imports.\n* Volume of Trade  (excluding oil and erratics) - In the three months to August 1996, the volume of\nexports and imports both rose 2 per cent compared with the previous three months. Latest estimates of\ntrends show both export and import volumes rising slightly. \n  \n* Trade in oil - The surplus on trade in oil in the three months ended August 1996 was £1.2 billion\ncompared with £1.1 billion in the previous three months. \n* Non-EC countries - The non-EU visible trade deficit in September was provisionally estimated at\n£0.9 billion.

In 1995 GDFCF was still 11% lower than the peak in 1989. \n* In the third quarter of 1996, total GDFCF fell by 2.2% compared to the previous quarter. However, the total\nremains 3% higher than in the same quarter of 1995.\n* A more detailed breakdown for the second quarter of 1996 shows rising fixed investment in vehicles,\nships & aircraft (up 44%) partly offset by falls in the major components of GDFCF: plant & machinery\nand other new buildings and works, which fell 5% and 0.4% respectively.\nNext up-date: 20 December\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/108\nG 1.

It lists the principal personal allowances\nwhich will be available against tax in the tax year 1997-98, and it outlines the conditions\nnecessary for eligibility for these allowances. As such, the paper provides a summary of the\ngeneral tax position in straightforward cases only. It should be stressed that this paper deals\nonly with tax allowances.

Rates and Thresholds\nIncome tax is charged at three rates - the lower rate, the basic rate, and the higher rate - on\nthree bands of taxable income. Taxable income excludes personal allowances, which\nrepresent the amount of money someone may receive free of tax. The basic rate of income\ntax will be cut by 1% to 23% for 1997-98. The lower and higher rates of income tax are to\nbe unchanged, and remain at 20% and 40% respectively.\nThe first £4,100 of an individual's taxable income is charged the lower rate for 1997-98. The\nlower rate band has been increased by £200 from £3,900; this is £100 above the increase in\nline with statutory indexation. Taxable income in excess of the lower rate threshold is\ncharged the basic rate of 23%. The upper limit of the basic rate band is increased by £600\nto £26,100 - which is line with indexation - for 1997-98. Taxable income in excess of this\nthreshold is charged the higher rate of 40%. The three tax rates and thresholds for 1997-98\nare summarised below:\nTaxable Income £ Tax Rate\nFirst £4,100 20%\n£4,101 - £26,100 23%\nOver £26,100 40%\nB. Personal Allowances\nThe statutory requirement to uprate personal allowances in line with inflation - the so-called\n\"Rooker-Wise\" amendment - was introduced under section 22 of the Finance Act 1977, and\nis consolidated in section 257C of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988. The\namendment was successfully made through the cross-party co-operation of Jeff Rooker and\nAudrey Wise with Nigel Lawson. All three argued that without indexation, inflation acted\nas an unauthorised, unintended and an unknown increase in taxation; in other words, taxation\n'by stealth'. By ensuring that any real changes in allowances would have to be voted on, the\namendment would ensure changes in the tax structure would be 'out in the open'. At the time\nMr Lawson noted, \"this does not hamstring the Chancellor in any way except to remove a\nbias which is there at present. It alters the political context and it will therefore have real\nconsequences.\"1\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n1 HC Deb 25 July 1977 cc 94-95\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nPersonal allowances should be increased by a percentage equivalent to the rise in the retail\nprice index (RPI), rounded up to the nearest £10; the income limit for age allowances should\nbe increased by a similar proportion but rounded up to the nearest £100. A similar statutory\nrequirement to uprate the lower and the basic thresholds in line with inflation, unless\nParliament determines otherwise, is provided under section 1 of ICTA 1988. In the case of\nthresholds, changes must be rounded up to the nearest multiple of £100.\nWhen uprating the main allowances and thresholds, the relevant inflation rate taken is the\nincrease in the RPI in the year to September. For the year to September 1996, the inflation\nrate was 2.1%.\nThe ordinary personal allowance is to be increased by £280 for 1997-98, £200 more than the\nincrease under statutory indexation. The age-related personal allowances are to be increased\nby £200 in excess of statutory indexation as well. The married couple's allowance, and those\nallowances linked to it, are all to be increased by £40 in line with inflation.\n1. Personal Allowance\nEvery taxpayer resident in the United Kingdom is entitled to a personal allowance to be set\nagainst any type of income including investment income. There are three different levels for\n1997-98:\nUnder 65 £4,045\n65 - 74 £5,220\n75 and over £5,400\nAll three allowances are to be increased by an additional £200 on top of the increase under\nstatutory indexation. The basic personal allowance rises by £280; both age related personal\nallowances rise by £310. The entitlement to age allowance is determined separately for each\nspouse based on their own age. The extra age allowance is reduced above a certain income\nlimit by £1 for every £2 by which income exceeds the limit (see section B3). However no\naged taxpayer receives less than the basic personal allowance available to those under 65.\nThe personal allowance is not transferable between spouses.\n2. Married Couple's Allowance\nA married couple's allowance (MCA) is given to all married couples. It can be claimed by\neither spouse, or divided between them. If no preference is expressed, the allowance is given\nto the husband. The wife has the right to claim half the MCA; couples must make a joint\nelection if she is to claim the entire allowance. A higher allowance is given to couples in\nwhich at least one partner is over 65 years old. A second higher rate is given if one partner\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nis over 75. Only the basic MCA is transferable between husband and wife; not the higher\nrates.\nThe ordinary MCA and the age-related allowances for 1997-98 are set out below:\nBoth aged\nunder 65\n£1,830\nOne or both\naged 65 - 74\n£3,185\nOne or both\naged 75+\n£3,225\nThe MCA is reduced by one twelfth for each complete tax month pre-marriage. The higher\nallowances for those over 65 are reduced above a certain income limit by £1 for every £2 of\nexcess income (see section B3).\nIn the March 1993 Budget the then Chancellor (Norman Lamont) announced that the MCA\nwould be restricted to 20 per cent from 6 April 1994, so that its money value would be the\nsame for all taxpayers whatever their marginal rate of tax. Personal allowances are worth\nmore to higher rate taxpayers, since they represent a fixed sum which is exempted from tax\nat an individual's highest marginal tax rate. At that time the basic MCA was set at £1,720,\nand was worth £688 for those whose marginal rate was 40 per cent; whereas it was worth\nonly £344 for 20 per cent taxpayers. Restricting the allowance to 20 per cent meant that all\ntaxpayers received £344 as a deduction from their final tax bill. In effect the allowance has\nbecome more like a tax credit. In the November 1993 Budget the current Chancellor,\nKenneth Clarke, announced that all three MCAs were to be further restricted to 15 per cent\nwith effect from 1995-96. The 15 per cent restriction will continue to apply to these\nallowances for 1997-98. As a result, the ordinary MCA will be worth £274.50 to all\ntaxpayers. The same restriction applies to the additional personal allowance, and to the\nwidow's bereavement allowance (these allowances are discussed below).\nAs a result of the introduction of independent taxation in April 1990, transitional allowances\nwere introduced to minimise the loss faced by those couples where the wife was the\nbreadwinner, and those couples where the wife was in a higher age allowance band than her\nhusband. These arrangements will affect fewer people as the years go by. Details are given\nin Independent Taxation, Library Research Note 90/9, 5 February 1990.\n3. Income Limit for Age Allowance\nTaxpayers claiming an age-related allowance whose income exceeds £15,600 for 1997-98 will\nhave their allowance reduced by £1 for every £2 that their income exceeds this limit. This\nprogressive reduction continues until the allowance is equal in value to that of the ordinary\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\npersonal allowance or the basic MCA. The income limit has been increased in line with\ninflation, from the limit of £15,200 for 1996-97. For individual taxpayers qualifying for an\nage-related personal allowance the benefit of the allowance will not fall out until the\nfollowing levels:\n65 - 74 £17,950\n75 and over £18,310\nFor the MCA, the figures will depend on the age of the husband and of the older spouse. The\nage-related personal allowance is reduced before the age-related MCA, when any individual's\ntax bill is calculated.2\n4. Additional Personal Allowance\nAn additional personal allowance (APA) is available in respect of individuals caring for\nchildren, and for husbands caring for an incapacitated wife. The allowance is equal in value\nto the ordinary married couple's allowance: £1,830 for 1997-98, restricted to 15 per cent. The\nchild may be the claimant's natural or adopted child, or simply a child maintained at the\nclaimant's expense (eg, fostered). The child has to be under 18, unless he or she is in full-\ntime education or in an apprenticeship of at least two years' duration. Those eligible for the\nAPA are:\n• a woman who is not, throughout the tax year in question, married and living with\nher husband.\n• a man who is not, for all or part of the tax year in question, married and living with\nhis wife.3\n• a man who is, for all or part of the tax year in question, living with his wife, if she\nis totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity throughout the tax year (of\ncourse, in this case, the allowance would be given in addition to the MCA). Married\nwomen caring for their incapacitated spouse are not eligible for the allowance.\nSingle or divorced women, as well as widows, widowers, and single men, may claim the\nAPA, provided they are taking care of at least one child (only one allowance is paid,\nirrespective of the number of children cared for by the claimant). If both parents, living apart,\nclaim the allowance in respect of the same child, then they may elect to have it split between\nthem. If they cannot agree, the allowance is split in proportion to the amount of time each\nparent spends with the child.4\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n     \n2 Under section 257A(5)(b) of ICTA 1988\n     \n3 Provided he is not entitled to the transitional tax relief given to couples who separated before 6 April 1990.\n     \n4 Under section 260 of ICTA 1988\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\n5. Spouse's Transitional Exemption\nThe tax treatment of maintenance was changed substantially by provisions in the Finance Act\n1988. Previously, those providing maintenance could apply for tax relief at their marginal\nrate of tax on their payments. The person receiving maintenance - ex-spouse or child - would\nbe taxed on this income. The 1988 reform removed these transactions from the tax system.\nThose who make payments cannot claim them against tax, and those who receive them are\nnot taxed on them. This applies to all maintenance payments made under a court order, a\nChild Support Agency assessment, or other type of legally binding agreement, made after 15\nMarch 1988.\nSeparated or divorced individuals who pay maintenance direct to their ex-spouse qualify for\na limited form of tax relief, sometimes called a 'maintenance allowance', equivalent to the\nMCA (ie, an allowance of no more than £1,830). This relief is not extended to those making\nmaintenance payments to an ex-partner, rather than to an ex-spouse, and it does not cover\nmaintenance paid to children. Individuals may claim relief for payments made to more than\none ex-spouse, but however many people they make payments to, the total amount of relief\ngiven in any one tax year is the same. Tax relief is withdrawn if the ex-spouse who receives\nmaintenance remarries. Relief has been restricted in the same way as the MCA: to 20 per\ncent for 1994-95, and to 15 per cent for 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98.\nUnder agreements made before 15 March 1988, the taxpayer will continue to receive tax relief\nat the level he or she was allowed in 1988-89, through the PAYE system. Tax relief on the\nfirst £1,830 of maintenance paid is restricted to 15 per cent for 1997-98. Those who receive\nmaintenance under the old system receive it gross. Where payments are made direct to an\nex-spouse, the first £1,830 may be received tax free (this relief has not been restricted).\n6. Widows Bereavement Allowance\nThe widows bereavement allowance (WBA) is intended to relieve some of the financial\ndistress of bereavement. It is set equal to the basic MCA (ie, £1,830 restricted to 15 per cent\nfor 1997-98). The allowance may be claimed as well as the additional personal allowance,\nand, of course, the personal allowance. It is available from the date of the death to the end\nof the following tax year, and applies against the widow's own income in this period. There\nis no corresponding allowance for widowers.\n7. Blind Person's Allowance\nAny person registered as blind is entitled to the blind person's allowance (BPA). The\nallowance is worth £1,280 for 1997-98, having been increased in line with inflation on the\nprevious year. Unlike the married couple's allowance, and those allowances linked to it, the\nBPA is not restricted in value. If someone has insufficient income to make use of the\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nallowance, it can be transferred to a spouse. In his 1996 Budget, the Chancellor proposed that\nthe WBA would become subject to the same statutory requirement for indexation as the other\nincome tax allowances.\nSummary Table of the Allowances\n£ 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98\nPersonal \nAllowance\n 3,445  3,445  3,445  3,525  3,765  4,045\n    \" (65 - 74)  4,200  4,200  4,200  4,630  4,910  5,220\n    \" (75 & +)  4,370  4,370  4,370  4,800  5,090  5,400\nMCA (basic)  1,720  1,720  1,720*  1,720*  1,790*  1,830*\nMCA (65 - 74)  2,465  2,465  2,465*  2,995*  3,115*  3,185*\nMCA (75 & +)  2,505  2,505  2,505*  3,035*  3,155*  3,225*\nAPA  1,720  1,720  1,720*  1,720*  1,790*  1,830*\nWBA  1,720  1,720  1,720*  1,720*  1,790*  1,830*\nIncome Limit 14,200 14,200 14,200 14,600 15,200 15,600\nBPA  1,080  1,080  1,080  1,200  1,250  1,280\n* Relief restricted to 20 per cent in 1994-95 and 15 per cent in the three tax years: 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nC. Benefits - Company Cars & Free Fuel\nIn April 1994 the system of car benefit charges - based on the size of a car's engine - was\nreplaced by a new system, based on the car's list price. A charge of 35 per cent of the price\nof a car is made, with discounts for business mileage and older cars.\nThe tax charge on the benefit of free fuel used in company cars for 1997-98 will increase by\n13 per cent for petrol cars, and 15 per cent for diesel cars. The intention is to increase the\ntax charge on the benefit of free fuel in line with the prices other drivers pay for their fuel.\nThe scale charges for 1997-98 are:\nPETROL CARS DIESEL CARS\nEngine size cc Scale charge £ Engine size cc Scale charge £\n0 - 1,400 800 0 - 2,000 740\n1,400 - 2,000 1,010 2,001 + 940\n2,001 + 1,490\nD. Pensions\nThe pension scheme earnings cap will be increased in line with inflation, from £82,200 to\n£84,000 for 1997-98. This is the maximum earnings from which contributions to a personal\nor occupational pension scheme can attract tax relief.\nE. Charities\nThere is no general tax exemption or relief granted to taxpayers who make gifts to charities,\nthough there are specific reliefs covering regular donations made out of one's salary (payroll\ngiving), and one-off cash gifts of a minimum size (Gift Aid), as well as to covenanted\ndonations.\nThe payroll giving scheme is designed to encourage employees to make contributions to\ncharity. The maximum amount which an employee can give remains £1,200 per year, set by\nthe Finance Act 1996. The annual amount paid in this way is wholly deductible for income\ntax purposes, the relief being given through the PAYE system. The employer deducts the\nappropriate sum from a participating employee's pay, and passes it to an agency who\ndistributes it to the charity or charities of the employee's choice. Gift Aid allows income tax\nrelief for single donations by individuals. When this relief was introduced, the minimum limit\nwas £600; the current minimum is £250, set by the Finance Act 1993.\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nF. Mortgages\nThere is no change to the £30,000 limit on loans qualifying for interest relief for the purchase\nof a main residence. Tax relief on mortgage interest (MIRAS) was limited to the basic rate\nof income tax from 6 April 1991. Relief was restricted to 20 per cent from 6 April 1994, and\nto 15 per cent from 6 April 1995. MIRAS remains restricted to 15 per cent for 1997-98.\nG. Capital Gains Tax\nThe annual exempt amount has been increased in line with statutory indexation, to £6,500 for\nindividuals, in accordance with the indexation of thresholds for capital taxes incorporated in\nsections 80 and 91 of the Finance Act 1982. Gains are then taxed at one's marginal rate of\nincome.\nH. Inheritance Tax\nInheritance tax is levied on the value of a person's estate at the time of their death. Generally,\npersonal gift giving is free from tax. However most gifts made out of someone's estate within\nseven years of their death are assessed as part of that person's estate, and are liable to tax as\nwell. The tax is charged at 40 per cent above the tax-free threshold. This is increased from\n£200,000 to £215,000 for 1997-98, £10,000 in excess of indexation. This follows a\nsubstantial increase of £46,000 last year. Taken together, the threshold has increased by\nnearly 40 per cent in two years (ie, from £154,000 to £215,000).\nI. Profit Related Pay\nProfit Related Pay (PRP) is that part of an employee's pay which rises, and falls, in line with\nthe profits of the business in which they work. Provided PRP is paid under a scheme\nregistered with the Inland Revenue, the employee may receive it free of income tax, up to a\ngiven limit: either 20% of their salary, or £4,000, whichever is the lower, in the profit period\nto which the PRP relates. A 'profit period' is the employer's accounting period, normally 12\nmonths. Currently, basic-rate taxpayers receiving PRP will pay up to £960 less income tax\n(24 per cent of £4,000) than an equivalent employee not receiving PRP. Higher-rate\ntaxpayers pay up to £1,600 per year less income tax.\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/109\nThe Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, has proposed in his November 1996 Budget that tax relief\nfor PRP be phased out over a three to four year period; so that for profit periods beginning\n • before 1 January 1998, there will be no change in the £4,000 ceiling on relief;\n • between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1998, the ceiling will be reduced to £2,000;\n • between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 1999, the ceiling will be reduced to £1,000;\n • on or after 1 January 2000, no relief will be available.\n13\n\n\nEconomic Policy & Taxation\nRecent research papers on related subjects have been:\n96/108 Economic indicators 25.11.96\n96/105 Unemployment by constituency 13.11.96\n96/103 Landfill 8.11.96\n96/33 Economic and monetary union 1.3.96\n96/18 The value of the £ since 1750 1.2.96\n95/129 Financial services : regulators and ombudsmen 13.12.95\n95/122 Overseas aid and the 1995 Budget 4.12.95\n\n\n\n"],"description_s":["Personal Tax Allowances and Reliefs 1997-98.

Introduction\nUnder the former rules this benefit was generally not affected by a hospital stay. Regulations\ncame into force on 31 July 1996 so that the allowance generally ceases after 4 weeks as an\nin-patient (12 weeks in the case of a child). They are due for debate on 5 December 1996.\nSome transitional protection for existing recipients is provided as described in the note.\nFurther discussion of the regulations and more detailed summary of responses to the\nconsultation exercise can be found in the Report by the Social Security Advisory Committee\non SI 1996/14361. This includes the regulations, an explanatory memorandum from the DSS\non the original regulations, a summary of the representations made to the SSAC, the SSAC\nreport on the regulations and the Secretary of State's statement on the report.\nB. Disability living allowance - the former rules\nDisability living allowance (DLA) is a benefit for disabled people. Its main features are:\n• Available to both children and adults;\n• Introduced in April 1992, replacing the old mobility allowance and attendance\nallowance for people under 65 with a single benefit;\n• Aimed at people who need help looking after themselves and who have difficulty\nwalking;\n• Tax-free, not means-tested or related to national insurance contributions;\n• Provided a person continued to satisfy the conditions of entitlement, the mobility\ncomponent of DLA was unaffected by a hospital stay. The care component is not paid\nafter 4 weeks for adults or 12 weeks for children.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n1 Cm 3233, June 1996\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nThere are two elements to DLA:\n• a care component for help with personal care needs, paid at three different levels;\n• a mobility component for help with walking difficulties, paid at two levels. The\nhigher rate is currently £33.90 pw and the lower £12.90 pw.\nIt is paid in addition to earnings or other income and generally the whole allowance is paid\non top of any other social security benefits.\nThe regulations affect the mobility component. To qualify for this, a person must be over 5\nand under 66 when they first claim. The must also be able, from time to time, to benefit from\n\"facilities for enhanced locomotion\"2. Thus a person who cannot be moved for medical\nreasons would not be eligible. They must also satisfy the disability conditions, detailed\nbelow:\nDLA mobility component conditions of entitlement\nFor the higher rate a person must be:\neither suffering from a physical disability such that they are\nunable to walk;\nor suffering from a physical disability such that they are\nvirtually unable to walk;\nor both deaf and blind;\nor a double amputee or have been born without feet;\nor severely mentally impaired and have severe\nbehavioural problems and qualify for the highest rate\nof disability living allowance care component.\nFor the lower rate a person needs to show that although they\nare able to walk they are so severely disabled, physically or\nmentally, that, ignoring familiar routes, they are unable to\ntake advantage of their walking abilities outdoors without\nguidance or supervision from another person most of the time.\nFor both rates a person must have satisfied one of these\nconditions for at least the past 3 months and be likely to\nsatisfy it for the next 6 months (unless they are terminally ill)\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n2 Section 73 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nC. Disability living allowance - the new rules\nFrom 31 July 1996, the mobility component of DLA is no longer paid after 4 weeks of an in-\npatient stay (12 weeks for children). \nThe change was first announced briefly by Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security,\nin his 1995 statement on the uprating of benefits. Among a number of measures to remove\nanomalies, he proposed to \"align the mobility component of disability living allowance more\nclosely with similar benefits that are withdrawn during hospital stays.\"3 The reasons for the\nchange were explained in an accompanying press notice:4\n\"DLA is intended to help with the extra costs arising out of a disability and the\nmobility component is primarily intended to help disabled people be\nindependently mobile.\nHospital patients, especially acute patients, have little scope to be\nindependently mobile whilst in hospital and most of their needs are met by the\nNHS. Most other Social Security benefits are either withdrawn or reduced\nwhen a person goes into hospital to prevent duplicate provision from public\nfunds. It cannot be right to pay people who are unable to use the benefit for\nthe purpose intended and who are already having most of their needs met by\nthe taxpayer.\nWe believe the move is justified in ensuring that taxpayers' money goes to\nthose best placed to benefit from it.\"\nIn the DSS' Explanatory Memorandum to the SSAC it was suggested that hospitals are\naccumulating large sums of money from unspent benefits paid to in-patients. Also, in some\ncases where the NHS was already meeting all a patient's needs, the allowance was being used\nto buy tobacco, cigarettes, sweets etc, rather than for mobility purposes. The DSS maintains\nthis is evidence of the healthcare and social security systems overlapping, both providing for\nthe same contingencies, and DLA as a result is either unspent or inappropriately spent.\n1. Transitional protection\nPartial protection was provided for some existing recipients of mobility component of DLA.\nThe regulations include provision to continue to pay the mobility component at the lower\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n3 HC Deb 29 Nov 95 c.1214\n4 DSS Press Notice 95/160, Peter Lilley Brings Disability Living Allowance in line with other benefits 29 Nov 1996 \n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nrate only to some patients who when the regulations come into force have been in hospital\nfor more than 12 months.\nExcluded, or partially excluded, from this protection are those who:\n• are committed to a hospital following involvement in criminal proceedings or under\nsentence5 and those who have been compulsorily admitted to hospital because of their\nneed for care and treatment as a result of their mental disorder6. They will be\nexcluded from the protection given to other long stay patients;\n• use their mobility component to pay for a car under the Motability scheme. They will\nhave their benefit paid at the higher of the lower rate or the level required to meet\npayments under the agreement for the hire or hire-purchase of the vehicle;\n• have been a NHS in-patient for less than 12 months at the time of the change.\nIn his statement on the regulations, Peter Lilley argues \"that it has long been accepted that\na person's needs are fully met during a period of hospital treatment. Where no charge is made\nfor that treatment, any payment of benefit intended to meet the same needs would amount to\ndouble provision from public funds. For this reason, most Social Security benefits are\nwithdrawn or reduced after a period, commonly 6 weeks, of free in-patient treatment in a\nhospital or similar institution.\"7 \nDLA mobility component is unusual in being largely unaffected by a spell as a hospital in-\npatient. It is common for benefits to be reduced during hospital stays. Often this first takes\nplace at six weeks or later. The proposals for DLA mobility component for those in hospital\nwould align it with the care component and Attendance Allowance which are withdrawn after\nfour weeks in the case of an adult. The payment of benefits for a short spell as an in-patient\nrecognises that financial commitments do not necessarily stop when someone goes into\nhospital; also they avoid the administrative costs of making adjustments of benefits for short\nhospital stays. Appendix 1 shows how a spell as a hospital in-patient affects various non-\nmeans-tested benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5 Sentenced prisoners are already excluded from benefit\n6 Including those detained under Parts II and III of the Mental Health Act 1983 or Parts V and VI of the Mental\n(Scotland) Act 1984.\n7 Cm 3233 para 4\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nD. SSAC consultation and response\nThe proposed regulations were referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC).\nThe SSAC requested representations to be made in a consultation exercise ending on\n12 February 1996. There were 189 responses and the overwhelming view of these was that\nthe proposals were based on false information and should not be implemented. The SSAC\nconcurred with this view and also thought the proposals would introduce many anomalies.\nIts main conclusion was that the proposals should not be proceeded with in their present form.\nThe SSAC also made a number of secondary recommendations, including:\n• A more rigorous analysis of the appropriateness and availability of NHS funding for\nthe mobility needs of patients should be carried out;\n• Persons detained under Part II or III of the Mental Health Act 1983 should have the\nsame entitlement as other patients;\n• Consideration should be given to patients who need to initiate or renew a Motability\nagreement before they are able to leave hospital;\n• A more gradual downrating of the mobility component for long-stay patients should\nbe examined.\n• A linking rule should be introduced in determining the 12 month period for\ntransitional protection;\nThe Government agreed with the last of these, and the regulations now allow people who are\nout of hospital for 28 days or less between in-patient stays to be treated if they had been\ncontinuously in hospital, and provision for this is now contained in the regulations8. However\nthey were unable to accept the other recommendations and considered the overall case for\nchange to be \"compelling\".9\nThe final regulations were laid before Parliament on 7 June 1996 and came into force on 31\nJuly 1996.10\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n8 Regulation 2(2)\n9 Cm 3233, Statement by the Secretary of State para 41\n10 SI 1996 1436\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nE. Reactions to the regulations\nThe overwhelming view of respondents to the SSAC consultation exercise was that the\nproposals were based on false information and should not be implemented, also that\nimplementation of the proposals would cause individual patients financial hardship and could\nlengthen their stay and thus increase other areas of public expenditure.11\nThe main concerns of respondents underlying their views were:\n• False assumptions made about the lack of mobility needs of long-stay patients and the\nmeeting of them by the NHS. The fact finding exercise carried out by the DSS was\nfundamentally flawed in not talking to patients or those directly responsible for their\nday-to-day care;\n• Alignment with DLA care component ignores separate benefit history and objectives.\nWhile it is easy to argue the NHS provides for the care needs of a patient and to give\nbenefit for these would be 'double provision', it is less clear that the NHS provides for\nall mobility needs in the same way.\n                                          \n• Long-stay patients, particularly, are often in hospitals in isolated areas and mobility\ncomponent can be used to enable them to make and receive visits. This is even more\nimportant where children are involved;\n• There is evidence that in many cases the mobility component is used imaginatively\nand constructively to enhance the quality of life of long-stay patients. Unspent\nbalances are evidence of poor organisation and provision rather than lack of mobility\nneed;\n• Patients in NHS-provided homes and hospitals will be worse-off than those in homes\nprovided by other bodies even though care provided and needs may be similar. The\nproposals run counter to the efforts to transfer care from hospital to community-based;\n• Transitional protection does not include people who have been in hospital for less than\na year who will lose benefit at 4 weeks. Also the exclusion of those in special\nhospitals, secure units and those detained in low/no security hospitals effectively puts\nthem in the same position as convicted prisoners (who are already barred from benefit)\nrather than patients;\n• Restriction of protection to those who have a vehicle via Motability excludes anyone\nwho has similar private arrangements. Also that it will not be possible to renew a\nMotability agreement while in hospital;\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n11 Cm 3233 Appendix 2\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\n• It is already possible under existing legislation12 to deny benefit to claimants who are\nunable to benefit from enhanced mobility. The reasons given by the DSS are not\nsufficient to justify the regulations.\nA fuller summary of representations made to the SSAC appears in its report.13\nF. Numbers affected and savings\nThe DSS estimates some 40,000 people would have their benefit payments of mobility\ncomponent reduced or withdrawn: 25,000 people on the higher rate who would have been in\nhospital for 12 months or more at the time of the change would have their payments reduced;\n15,000 who are either in-patients of less than 12 months or new cases would have benefit\nwithdrawn.14\nWithin the group of patients who have been in hospital for more than 12 months are around\n3,000 patients in special hospitals or secure units whose payments would cease.\nAround 35,000 patients receiving the lower rate who would have been in hospital for\n12 months or more at the change will see no variation in their benefit.\nThe savings from the change are put at £25 million in 1996/7 and £40 million in 1997/8.\nAround three-quarters of the savings are due to the change in the rules for adults and a\nquarter from the change as it affects children.15\nA number of respondents to the consultation exercise questioned whether the cost of the\nchange can be measured entirely in terms of benefits no longer paid. They pointed out that\nsome of the savings could be offset by additional costs faced by the NHS if the change results\nin prolonging the length of stay of patients or hindering efforts to provide rehabilitation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                            \n12 Section 73 Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992\n13 Cm 3233 Appendix 2\n14 DSS Explanatory Memorandum to the SSAC\n15 HC Deb 23 April 1996 c135W\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/111\nAppendix 1\nEffect of hospital stays on non-means-tested benefits\nTime in hospital\nBenefit At least 1 day 4 weeks 6 weeks 12 weeks 1 year\nStatutory sick pay\nStatutory maternity pay\nMaternity allowance\nPaid for only a limited period only, otherwise unaffected by a stay in hospital\nIncapacity benefit\nSevere disablement allowance\nRetirement pension\nWidowed mother's allowance\nWidow's pension\nIf (non-spouse)\nadult dependent is\nin hospital,\ndependent's\nincrease generally\nstops\nBenefit for people\nadmitted from local\nauthority homes\nreduced to\n£12.25pw\nNo further\nchange\nBenefit reduced to\n£24.50pw (unless\npatient has\ndependents - when\nreduced by\n£12.25pw)\nIf dependent\nspouse is in\nhospital,\ndependent's\naddition where\npaid is reduced by\n£12.25pw or to\n£12.25 whichever\nis most beneficial\nIf dependent\nchild is in\nhospital,\ndependent's\nincrease only\ncontinues only if\nthe claimant is\nstill contributing\nto his/her\nmaintenance\nBenefit reduced to\n£12.25pw\n12\n\n\nTime in hospital\nBenefit At least 1 day 4 weeks 6 weeks 12 weeks 1 year\nDisablement benefit No change Constant\nattendance\nallowance\nstops\nUnemployability\nsupplement is\nreduced in the\nsame way as\nincapacity benefit \nNo further\nchange\nUnemployability\nsupplement is\nreduced in the\nsame way as\nincapacity benefit\nInvalid care allowance (where carer\nhospitalised)\nNo change Benefit stops\nChild benefit and one parent benefit No change Benefit continues as long as the patient\nis still contributing to the maintenance\nof the child\nDLA (mobility component) No change Benefit stops if\nclaimant 16 or\nover\nIf claimant under\n16 benefit stops\nDLA (care component)\nAttendance allowance\nNo change Benefit stops if\nclaimant 16 or\nover\nIf claimant under\n16 benefit stops\n \n13\n\n\nRecent Research Papers\n96/101 The Education Bill [Bill 8 of Session 1996/97] 06.11.96\n96/102 Controls on Firearms: The Firearms (Amendment) Bill 08.11.96\n96/103 Landfill 08.11.96\n96/104 Hong Kong: The Final Stages 13.11.96\n96/105 Unemployment by Constituency - October 1996 13.11.96\n96/106 The Working Time Directive 19.11.96\n96/107 The Social Security Administration (Fraud) Bill \n[Bill 15 of 1996/97] 20.11.96\n96/108 Economic Indicators 25.11.96\n96/109 Personal Tax Allowances & Reliefs 1997-98 27.11.96\n96/110 Economic & Monetary Union [not yet printed]\n\n\n\n"],"description_s":["Disability living allowance mobility component and hospital in-patients.

Nirex's remit is to develop disposal routes for\nintermediate-level waste (ILW) and certain types of relatively hazardous low-level waste\n(LLW) (see later). It is important to differentiate between disposal, which implies\npermanency, and storage, which is designed as a temporary measure.\nAfter numerous deliberations Nirex is currently working to provide and manage a deep\nunderground repository for the wastes within its remit at Longlands Farm, near Sellafield in\nCumbria. In addition to a test drilling programme involving a series of boreholes, Nirex\nproposes to excavate a Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF) or \"rock laboratory\" at the site\nto develop its safety case prior to excavating the repository itself. It is the RCF, at present\nat the centre of a contentious planning appeal, which is the subject of this paper.\nMajor features of the Government's radioactive waste management policy are described in\nLibrary Research Paper 96/30 - Radioactive Waste: Some Topical Issues. This sets Nirex's\nposition within the UK's policy for radioactivity waste management in context.\n5\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nII. History\nNirex has arrived at its present position by a long and tortuous route. Several other policies\nand sites have been considered and rejected along the way, not least because of public dissent\ncharacterised by the Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) syndrome1:\n37. When Nirex was established by the nuclear industry in 1982, its task, in line with the\nGovernment's policy at that time, was to develop two disposal routes for ILW and LLW:\n(a) deep disposal of long-lived ILW in an underground repository; and\n(b) shallow burial of LLW and short-lived ILW in engineered trenches 20 to 30\nmetres below the surface.\nInitially, Nirex explored the possibility of developing a disused ICI anhydrite mine at\nBillingham in Cleveland as a deep repository, but in 1985, following local and national\ncontroversy, ICI decided not to make the mine available to Nirex. At the Government's\nrequest, Nirex than concentrated on finding a site for a shallow repository for LLW and short-\nlived ILW.\n38. Elstow in Bedfordshire had originally been identified in 1983 as the potential site for a\nshallow repository, but in 1986 Nirex's investigations were widen to include three other\nlocations in the clay geology of Eastern England. The same year, the Government accepted\nthe recommendations of the Environment Select Committee that no ILW should be disposed\nof in near-surface facilities. In 1987, the proposals were dropped and Nirex concentrated\ninstead on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose facility for both ILW and\nLLW. This, it argued, would be the most cost-effective solution.\n39. In 1989, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced Nirex's recommendation\nthat a deep repository should be developed on land rather than under the sea and that the next\nstep should be to carry out detailed geological studies in the vicinity of Sellafield and\nDounreay. The Government agreed that further exploratory work was necessary before any\nparticular site could be decided on. In July 1991, Nirex announced that it would concentrate\nits investigations on Sellafield. In addition to its test-drilling programme there, Nirex\nproposes to excavate a Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF), or \"rock laboratory\", more than\n650 m deep in order to help develop the safety case for the repository.\n                                                                                                                      \n                                                     \n1\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Preliminary Conclusions, Department of the Environment,\nAugust 1994\n6\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nA planning application for the RCF was submitted to Cumbria County Council on 1 February\n1994 and refused on 20 December. This is separate from the planning application for the\nrepository itself, for which the Government has promised2 its own full public inquiry.\nOn 27 February 1995 the Environment Secretary, John Gummer, announced3 that a planning\nappeal by Nirex for the RCF would be considered in September 1995. This took place and\nclosed on 1 February 1996. The report of the appeal was originally expected to be delivered\nto the Secretary of State for the Environment by the end of October. In the answer to a\nrecent parliamentary question this date was postponed4:\nDr John Cunningham : To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment (1) when he\nexpects to make a decision on the planning appeal for the construction of a rock\ncharacterisation facility at Longlands farm, Gosforth, Cumbria;\n(2) when he expects to receive the planning inspector's report relating to the inquiry into the\nconstruction of a rock characterisation facility at Longlands farm, Gosforth, Cumbria.\nMr Jones: The Planning Inspectorate has advised that it expects to send the report to my\nright Hon. Friend the Secretary of State in mid-December. Until we have received and\nconsidered the report, I cannot say when the decision on the appeal might be made.\nThe announcement that it is uncertain when a decision on the appeal might be made is\ninteresting. Similar uncertainties have surrounded previous cases. Most notably the decision\nabout a shallow repository. In that instance the decision to drop plans was announced just\nbefore parliament was dissolved for the 1987 election5. Dr David Clark for the Labour Party\nwelcomed the decision and said:\nHowever, we recognise, as does the rest of the country, that the Government have acted only\nin a squalid attempt to save themselves from electoral embarrassment. There can be no other\nexplanation for this announcement being made today. If I lived in one of the four\nconstituencies affected, I would need more reassurance than that given by the Government\nthat they will not reverse the policy if by an accident they happen to win the next election.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n2\n Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions, Cm 2919 July 1995\n3\n Department of Environment, News Release No93, 1995\n4\n HC Deb 5 November 1996 c464w\n5\n HC Deb 1 May 1987 c504-12\n7\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nIII. Classes of Radioactive Waste\nRadioactive waste in the UK is divided into four broad categories depending upon its\nradioactivity and associated heat generating capacity:\n• High-Level Waste (HLW) is waste in which sufficient heat is generated for\nthis to be a significant consideration in the design of storage and disposal\nfacilities. Essentially HLW consists of fission products (ie the radioactive\nremains) of uranium and plutonium from spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors;\n• Intermediate-Level Waste (ILW)  is waste in which the radioactive decay\nprocess generates insufficient heat for this to be a design requirement in\nstorage or disposal facilities, but with activity levels above that defined as the\nupper limit for low-level waste (see below). It comprises cladding from spent\nnuclear fuel, filters and wastes from effluent treatment, worn-out plant and\nequipment, and radioactive materials used in medical treatments, industry and\ndefence;\n• Low-Level Waste (LLW) is waste which contains radioactive materials above\nthe very low-level waste acceptable for disposal with ordinary refuse, but\nbelow 4 GBq6 per tonne of alpha (α)7 or 12 GBq per tonne of β8/γ9 activity.\nIt includes rubble and steelwork from decommissioning of nuclear reactors and\nitems such as rubber glovers and protective clothing;\n• Very Low-Level Waste (VLLW) is waste which can safely be disposed of\nwith ordinary refuse.\nNirex's remit is to develop disposal routes only for ILW and a small quantity of relatively\nhazardous LLW which are α-emitters of long half-life10.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n6\n 1 GBq (gigabequerel) is 1,000,000,000 radioactive emissions per second.\n7\n alpha or α-particles consist of two protons and two neutrons which form the nucleus, or central heavy part\nof the helium atom.\n8\n beta or β-particles are electrons which are constituents of atoms.\n9\n gamma or γ-rays are electromagnetic rays, like light.\n10\n the half-life is the time taken for half of any given amount of a radioactive element to decay.\n8\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nCurrently ILW is stored on the surface at nuclear power stations and other facilities. At\npresent there is a volume that would cover a football pitch to a depth of 40 feet (90,000 cu\nmetres). This is expected to double early on next century11. \nMost LLW is currently disposed off by shallow burial at British Nuclear Fuels' Drigg site in\nCumbria. This is not expected to be full until well into next century. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n11\n Nirex - the facts, Nirex, September 1994\n9\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nIV. Containment of Radioactivity in the Repository\nRadioactivity decays with time. In many cases this occurs relatively quickly, but certain\nelements have such a long half-life that significant radioactivity remains for many thousands\nof years. Because the hazard associated with radioactive waste, although constantly\ndecreasing, remains for such a long time in some cases, it is necessary to ensure its prolonged\ncontainment in the proposed repository. To this end a set of man-made and natural barriers\nare planned to isolate the waste from man's environment12:\n• the waste would be packed in steel drums or boxes with a cement mixture\npoured to the brim. This in itself is expected to provide a high degree of\nphysical containment for at least 1,000 years during which time about 99% of\nthe radioactivity will have decayed;\n• a special cement grout has been developed which would be used to back-fill\nthe space between the drums after they have been placed underground. The\nchemical nature of this grout will ensure that alkaline13 conditions are\nmaintained for upwards of 1,000,000 years. By this time more than 99.99% of\nthe original radioactivity will have decayed. In addition the grout is porous\nenough to allow \"sorption\" ie the attachment of materials to its surface. Such\nconditions help to chemically and physically immobilise the radioactive\nmaterials within the repository;\n• the repository, which would be sealed upon-closure, is planned about half-a-\nmile underground. The overlying rocks provide the final barrier to prevent\nradioactive material reaching the human environment.\nThe aim is to prevent radioactive material from coming into contact with groundwater in\nwhich it could dissolve, because this is the principal route by which radioactive material could\nbe transported from a repository through the overlying rock to the surface where it could\naffect humans.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n12\n A world of science, Nirex, 1996\n13\n Alkaline describes a solution that has an excess of hydroxide ions. This condition slows the rate that\nradioactive material will dissolve in groundwater.\n10\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nV. The Rock Characterisation Facility\nDespite the integrity of the containment designed for the radioactive material planned for the\nrepository, it is essential for Nirex to prove that the proposed repository will be safe. To\nachieve this Nirex formulated a scientific programme to carry out a post-closure performance\nassessment (PCSA) for a repository at Longlands Farm near Sellafield. It comprised\nactivities to14:\n- characterise the geological and hydrogeological conditions at the site which will\ninfluence the post-closure safety performance of a repository.\n- develop the data and models to describe the processes influencing radionuclide return\nto the human environment.\nResults from these activities feed into the development of the methodology and models which\nwill be used to evaluate post-closure safety performance.\n \nTo this end numerous boreholes have been drilled in the area. These provide rock cores\nwhich can be examined mineralogically. In addition equipment which emits and detects\nsound waves can be lowered into the boreholes. This is employed in a technique known as\nseismic tomography (similar to the technique used in whole body scanners in hospitals) to\nbuild up a picture of the rock structure. Groundwater flow properties have also been\nmeasured, and samples of groundwater and dissolved gases at depth have been taken to\ninvestigate groundwater age and evolution. Boreholes, however, are only able to yield some\nof the information required. To determine detail an underground laboratory known as the\nRock Characterisation Facility (RCF) is necessary. \nThe main objectives of the RCF programme were stated in Nirex Report 32715as follows:\n- to provide geological and hydrogeological characterisation data and scope for a model\nvalidation programme which will permit a firmer assessment of long-term safety:\n- to provide data needed to decide on a footprint, design and orientation for a\nrepository within the geologically suitable zone; and\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n14\n Review of aspects of the scientific mission and role of the Nirex RCF at Sellafield, RWMAC, September 1995\n15\n A Rock Characterisation Facility Consultative Document, Nirex, October 1992\n11\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\n- to provide geotechnical data on rock competence and fracture characteristics to\ninform decisions on repository construction methods and to enable cost estimates to\nbe refined.\nThe same Nirex Report also explained the testing capabilities that the RCF would offer in\naddition to surface-based investigations already carried out:\n- bulk data can be obtained in three dimensions from a large volume of rock, rather\nthan from isolated lengths of rock core drilled from the surface;\n- specialised tests can be performed directly on specific features; and\n- tests are less constrained by the limitation of design or location of surface\ninvestigations.\nIt is planned that the RCF will develop in phases16. Two deep vertical shafts will be sunk to\nabout 920m and 790m from the surface. These will each be 5m in diameter and 50m apart.\nFrom these, three main horizontal galleries will be constructed each about 150m long at a\ndepth currently planned to be 735m below the surface. Two of these galleries will be\nextended to 375m and 600m, and three further galleries up to 200m will be constructed. The\nfollowing diagram is a representation of the RCF at completion17.\n  \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n16\n Rock Characterisation Facility, Nirex, July 1994\n17\n Nirex-the facts, Nirex, September 1994\n12\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nFigure 1 An artist's view of the Rock Characterisation Facility\nAt each phase various aspects of the scientific programme will be carried out.

Views of Independent Bodies\nThree major independent bodies have carried out evaluations of the scientific issues associated\nwith deep disposal of radioactive waste in the UK. These are the Royal Society, the\nRadioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC), and Her Majesty's\nInspectorate of Pollution. These evaluations were quoted by those giving evidence to the\nRCF Inquiry.\nA. The Royal Society Report\nThe Royal Society Report20 was concerned with the development of generic guidelines for an\nunderground repository irrespective of the specific site.\nAfter its deliberations the society retained an open mind whether Sellafield has the potential\nto be the site for a deep underground repository. In the context of Nirex's current plans for\nsuch a repository it expressed concern in its recommendations about several issues. One of\nthese was the short timescale proposed:\nThe timetable of the programme needs to respect the fact that much of the science essential\nfor long-term performance of repositories for long-lived wastes is still at an early stage of\ndevelopment.\nThe society suggested splitting the research and development programmes into two. One\nprogramme would deal with short-lived ILW and some LLW for which repository\ncharacteristics are well established, the other requiring extra time and further work aimed at\nlong-lived ILW and possibly HLW:\nA more robust strategy for the UK would entail aiming to construct an initial part of the\nrepository for short-lived wastes within the zone of rock that Nirex are presently characterising\nin detail, with a more extended programme for the disposal of long-lived wastes, possibly in\na second-phase repository sited deeper and in a west-ward extension of the presently defined\npotential repository zone, but sharing common access and surface facilities. The practicability\nof disposing of high level wastes, as well as long-lived intermediate level wastes, in this\nsecond-phase repository could be investigated with advantage.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n20\n Disposal of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories, The Royal Society, November 1994\n14\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nComments were also made that Nirex should make its research results more widely available\nand open for peer review, a criticism also expressed by others21:\nThe iterative process of developing post-closure performance assessments for UK deep\nrepositories for radioactive wastes should be open to wide scientific peer review, particularly\nthe databases, the interpretation of site-specific data and the analysis of assessment results for\nspecific potential repository sites. This would complement the peer review of Nirex generic\nresearch that already takes place through publication and international cooperation. The fact\nthat Nirex initiated the present study is a positive signal of willingness to seek external inputs\nto their scientific strategy.\nThe society recommended further research on the effect of future climate change and\ngroundwater movement to assist in the post-closure performance assessments:\nA range of scenarios to represent the possible long-term evolutions of conditions at repository\nsites, addressing the consequences of climate changes through future glacial periods, needs to\nbe developed in order to make substantial progress in assessing the post-closure performance\nof repositories for long-lived wastes.\nFor credible assessments of the long-term performance of repositories, there is a need for a\nmore profound understanding of groundwater movement in fractured rocks, particularly in\nresponse to the influence of climate change. For the macroscale, use should be made of\nobserved geochemistry and simulations of the historical conditions that have led to it. At an\nintermediate scale, fracture flow determined by tracer tests and other field experiments should\nbe used to improve knowledge of the relationships between fracture patterns and groundwater\nmovement, and hence to calibrate numerical models of flow.\nIn the previous paragraph 'macroscale' refers to the large-scale overview of the groundwater\nmovement, and 'tracer tests' are experiments in which a small (or trace) quantity of a\ndetectable substance is introduced into the groundwater at one point and by detecting where\nit emerges groundwater movement can be charted.\nIn conclusion the society recognised the need for an RCF and the role it will play in the\nestablishment of the safety case:\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n21\n Nature, 31 October 1996\n15\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nThe \"rock characterisation facility\" (RCF) will provide a valuable base for site-specific studies,\nand should be operated for a long enough period to enable such studies to contribute\nsubstantially to detailed post-closure performance assessments. Nirex should encourage wide\ninternational participation in the planning and performance of experiments undertaken at the\nRCF, and in the interpretation of the experimental results.\nB. The RWMAC Report\nThe Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC) was established in 1978\nto advise the Government on civil radioactive waste management issues. In 1994 Nirex\ninvited RWMAC to carry out a review of its scientific mission for the proposed RCF. At\nthe same time Cumbria County Council also asked RWMAC to comment on a number of\nissues related to the RCF, including its potential role beyond its function as a rock laboratory\nfor generic purposes.\nThe RWMAC Report22 addressed all of these issues. In its conclusion the Report endorsed\nthe need for the RCF to enable the safety case to be made for the proposed repository.\nRWMAC expressed concern, however, about the timescale for the scientific programme and\nquestioned whether sufficient data would be available for the inquiry into the repository itself.\nIt also mentioned the need to use the RCF as an integral part of the repository to meet a\ncommissioning date for it of about 201023.\nThe RCF is an integral and necessary part of the overall Nirex science programme forming\nan essential step in establishing the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of\nconstruction. The timing of the RCF, in relation to the current overall Nirex programme, is\nsuch that only limited data will be available at the time that a planning application would be\nmade for the repository. It is, however, important that the results of the RCF programme be\navailable in time for that inquiry. For Nirex to have assurance of achieving the planned date\nfor commissioning of the repository by around 2010, then it would be necessary to use the\nRCF shafts for construction purposes.\nIt is this secondary use of the RCF which has led environmental groups to question whether\nthe RCF is a \"trojan horse\" for the repository24.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n22\n Review of aspects of the scientific mission and role of the Nirex Rock Characterisation Facility at Sellafield,\nRWMAC, September 1995\n23\n This date has slipped slightly to 2012 (Nature 31 October 1996)\n24\n UK Radioactive Waste Policy: Not a legacy to stand on, Greenpeace, December 1994 p5\n16\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nC. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution Assessment\nHer Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) have carried out a highly technical assessment\nof the site characterisation near Sellafield25. In addition to a review of Nirex's reports,\nreviews have been carried out of the geology of the East Irish Sea Basin and fracturing within\nthe Borrowdale Volcanic Group where the repository is planned. The Assessment praises\nthe high quality of Nirex work:\nThe quality of work which Nirex have and are continuing to carry out in the Sellafield area\nis generally of a very high standard, with the quality of the core material and the care taken\nto achieve the highest quality results being admirable. Much of the work carried out is an\nobject lesson on how to carry out a site investigation. There is still, however, much left to\ndo and this section of the report sets out where data and understanding are still lacking, and\nwhere uncertainties remain.\nThe work reviewed and suggested is of a highly technical nature and is therefore not dealt\nwith here, but can be accessed in the Assessment itself if required. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n25\n HMIP Assessment of Nirex Proposals Performance Assessment Project (Phase 2), HMIP, October 1994\n17\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nVII. Opposition from Environmental Groups\nTwo of the main environmental groups in the UK, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth\n(FOE), have differing perspectives upon disposal of radioactive waste.\nA. Greenpeace\nGreenpeace is wholly opposed to disposal (which it terms 'dumping') and would prefer storage\nso that waste would be retrievable26:\nThe problems of nuclear waste should be recognised as intractable. All that can be hoped for\nis a 'least bad' approach that takes account of public concern and minimises the burdens on\nfuture generations. Nuclear waste should be stored, monitored, and retrieved if something\ngoes wrong. Dumping is an irreversible commitment of nuclear waste to the environment.\nThe only solution is to stop nuclear waste production at source. That means closing down\nBritain's nuclear power stations and plutonium reprocessing factories.\nGreenpeace has specific objection to the choice of the site near Sellafield for the repository.\nIt questions the grounds upon which the decision was based: was it scientific evidence or\npolitical expediency27.\nThe site has been described by Sir Hugh Rossi MP, former Chairman of the Environment\nSelect Committee of the House of Commons, as politically 'the easiest solution', being in an\narea where the public are dependent on the nuclear industry for their livelihoods. At the same\ntime, geological criteria for site selection have been ignored.\nThe properties of the rock in which the waste is to be buried are intended to help isolate it\nfrom the environment for hundreds of thousands of years, but Nirex have broken UK,\nEuropean Community and International Atomic Energy Authority guidelines in their\nchoice of site:\nThe proposed dump is in a major fault zone.\nRadioactive springs forming as a result of an earthquake in the area could supply\ndrinking water. Springs have formed in the recent past following an earthquake\nalong the same fault zone.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n26\n UK Radioactive Waste Policy: Not a legacy to stand on, Greenpeace, December 1994\n27\n Earthquake, Greenpeace, November 1994\n18\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nThe site is too complicated for scientists to work out if it is safe.\nNirex don't know where all the fractures are that could take water back to the surface\nfrom the dump, or how fast water will flow through them and the numerous different\nrock types. Only one connective fracture is required to supply a radioactive spring\nto the surface.\nWater will flow from the waste towards the surface and fractures provide fast flow\nroutes.\nRadioactive water could reach the surface long before it is safe.\nThe proposed dump is below a sandstone aquifer that is an important water resource.\nFuture generations could dig a well and pump up radioactive water to drink.\nIn other countries the site would be excluded from consideration for a deep dump. The\nincreased radiation risks to the public and environment due to such poor site selection are\nimpossible to quantify. The risk to individuals of death from cancer due to leaking\nradioactive substance is likely to be far higher than at other sites, and is known with even less\ncertainty. The UK government, far from dealing with the problems, has recently proposed\nweakening the regulations, so that the current risk limit no longer has to be met.\nThe proposed weakening of regulations is amplified by Greenpeace elsewhere28:\nWeakening Standards. The Government is proposing to weaken standards of protection from\nman-made radiation sources. Current regulations (the 1984 Green Book) state that the risk of\nfatal cancer in an individual due to all man made sources, excluding medical, should not\nexceed 1 in 100,000 in any one year. This led to a dose limit of 1 milli-sievert for an\nindividual. It is now believed that the risk of death associated with this dose (1 milli-sievert)\nis five times higher - 1 death in 20,000. So rather than change the dose limits to correct the\nmistake and restore a risk of 1 in 100,000 the current proposal is to keep the limit the same\nand accept five times the risk.  New dose limits should be defined to correct the mistake\nmade.\nIn the conclusion to its closing submission to the public inquiry Greenpeace summarised its\nreasons for recommending that the application for the RCF at Longlands Farm be refused as\nfollows29:\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n28\n UK Radioactive Waste Policy: Not a legacy to stand on, Greenpeace, December 1994\n29\n Radioactive waste disposal at Sellafield, UK edited by RS Haszeldine and DK Smythe (p204)\n19\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\n(a) the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development will meet its stated purpose.\nIt is highly unlikely, if not impossible, in Greenpeace's view that the RCF will ever\nsufficiently characterise the site for a Detailed Safety Assessment to be made;\n(b) alternatively, if the RCF could achieve its purpose, which is unlikely, then it will become\nan integral part to the development of a Deep Waste Repository (DWR). However, one\ncannot be confident that the Nirex approach so far will provide the greatest measure of\nradiological safety to the public, and the significant economic commitment to the site at this\nstage may lead to greater risks;\n(c) Nirex has failed to provide any reliable assessments of results of its investigation\nprogramme so far. It is therefore not possible to determine what benefits, if any, could be\ngained from obtaining additional information from the RCF;\n(d) alternative sites exist which appear to offer significantly better levels of safety. It is\nimperative whilst disposal remains Government policy, that those sites are fully investigated\nif there is to be any development of a DWR in the UK.\nB. Friends of the Earth\nFOE, on the other hand, is not opposed to disposal in principle. Its aim is to ensure a\nsustainable policy for both energy and the radioactive waste that results 30:\n1.2 Within FOE, the Energy, Nuclear and Climate Campaign, which was launched in\n1973, is one of its longest running campaigns. Its principal aim is to promote a safe\nand sustainable energy policy at all levels of energy supply and use, both in the UK\nand internationally. The second of the Campaign's goals is to ensure that \"the\nradioactive legacy resulting from the use of nuclear power is managed and passed on\nto future generations in the least environmentally damaging way possible.\"\nFOE is not opposed in principle to the proposed RCF, but considers the planning application\nto be premature31:\n\"Within the staged development of a nuclear waste repository construction of a Rock\nCharacterisation Facility will be required. However, it is critically important that RCF\nconstruction is not undertaken prematurely.\" FOE's case demonstrates that the current\napplication is premature. \n                                                                                                                                                                           \n30\n Closing Statement of FOE at the Public Planning Inquiry into the RCF,  FOE, 1996\n31\n Radioactive waste disposal at Sellafield, UK  edited by RS Haszeldine and DK Smythe (p204) \n20\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nIts Statement of Case at the Inquiry is more specific about the scientific investigations\nrequired before a planning application is made32:\n\"FOE contends, and will call evidence to show, that by carrying out an inadequate site\nselection exercise Nirex has selected a site for the RCF which is geologically complex and has\na complicated groundwater flow pattern about which it still has an inadequate understanding.\nFOE will show that because of the damage that proceeding with the RCF would cause\nplanning permission should not be granted for the RCF until such time as Nirex has gained\nan adequate appreciation of the full nature and complexities of the site. FOE further contends\nthat to proceed with the RCF before adequate investigations have been carried out, will render\na properly justified decision about whether the site is suitable for a repository much more\ndifficult to take and may make it impossible.\"\nC. Other Groups\nThe Consortium of Opposing Local Authorities (COLA) which bases its case largely upon\nthe studies by FOE, the Royal Society and HMIP, is opposed to the deep repository near\nSellafield for safety reasons33.\nCumbria County Council has also concluded that there is a significant likelihood that a\nsafety case for the development of a repository at Sellafield cannot be made and that it is \"a\npoor site chosen for the wrong reasons\"34. It argues that there is a clear alternative to the\nSellafield site known as Site 6 in Nirex evidence. This is in eastern Europe35:\nThe County Council believes that the decision by the Nirex Board to reject this alternative\nsite, which is geologically and radiologically superior to Sellafield, was unsound and that it\nis not sensible to enter into the commitment that the RCF represents when this alternative still\nmerits serious investigation.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n32\n Radioactive waste disposal at Sellafield, UK  edited by RS Haszeldine and DK Smythe (p204) \n33\n Nuclear Waste Disposal: Some Fundamental Uncertainties, No 19 COLA, January 1996\n34\n G Richardson A Poor Site Chosen for the Wrong Reasons, Cumbria County Council News Release, 27\nNovember 1995\n35\n New information from Nirex Shows Better Alternative to Sellafield, Cumbria County Council News Release,\n31 October 1995\n21\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nVIII. Deep disposal in geological formations in other\ncountries\nDeep geological disposal for HLW, spent fuel (which is classed as HLW), and ILW of long\nhalf-life is considered to be safe and is a feature of radioactive waste management polices in\nmany countries. In fact every western country with a significant nuclear programme operates\nor is planning for deep geological disposal. In comparison with other countries, the UK's\npolicy for such a disposal route for ILW and some LLW would seem conservative.\nThe design of individual facilities vary and are determined largely by the geology of the site.\nIn many countries the use of in situ investigation facilities, such as boreholes or an\nunderground research laboratory (URL) similar to the RCF are a preliminary to the final\ndesign process for a repository.\nIn a number of countries repositories have been located in existing underground mines where\nthere are already in situ laboratories (Germany). In some countries where site selection has\nnot been finalised a 'reference' URL (i.e. at a trial site) is considered suitable (Canada and\nJapan). Other countries may construct a URL at a later stage of the process for site selection\n(France and USA), whilst others may not require a URL at all (Finland).\nThe position in a number of countries was fully described in Nuclear Energy36 early in 1994\nfrom which the following extracts are taken:\nGermany\nGermany intends to dispose of all its radioactive wastes (and, separately, its toxic wastes) in\ndeep geological formations. Prior to reunification, East Germany used the abandoned\nBartensleben salt mine, near the town of Morsleben, as a repository for LLW and ILW. Some\n450m deep, it has a capacity of 15,000 cubic metres and began operation in 1979. Recently,\nthe German courts granted permission for its continued operation until the year 2000, when\na new licence will be sought. There had been some concern over its operations but on\nexamination by the West Germany radio-active waste disposal agency, DBE, these were not\nfound to be wanting.\nThe former iron ore mine at Konrad in Lower Saxony will, if found suitable, become the\nrepository for all non-heat generating wastes. It lies at depths of between 800-1300m,\noverlain by clay. A decision on the commencement of waste emplacement is expected by\nmid-1994.\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n36\n Nuclear Energy: Special Issue - The Nirex Repository, February 1994\n22\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nThe Gorleben repository, also in Lower Saxony, will take all wastes including heat-generating\nand spend fuel. The intended depth is about 900m in a salt dome underlying a gypsum rock\ncap. Shaft sinking started in 1986 and extensive underground tests to determine the\ngeological structure and draw up the detailed repository design are due to be completed in the\nlate 1990s. Construction is due to start at that time with the repository becoming operational\nin 2008.\nResearch and development into disposal in salt has been carried out at the former Asse salt\nmine since 1965 at depths of down to 1000m. Demonstrations of LLW and ILW disposal\nwere carried out until 1978 but work recently had focused on HLW disposal.\nFrance \nFrance has a significant spent-fuel reprocessing industry and spent fuel is regarded as a\nresource. It is committed through legislation to research deep disposal of long-lived wastes\nin rock laboratories at two candidate sites. The selection programme for these was announced\nin March 1992 and the choice of potential sites may be announced later this year. It is\nintended to ensure that a range of options will be available when disposal decisions are made\nin about 15 years time. This will necessitate a change in the law. Given a favourable\ndecision by the Government, a 400-1000m deep repository is intended at one of the URL\nsites\nUSA\nDeep geological disposal is the method chosen by the USA for TRU37 waste and HLW. A\nwaste isolation pilot plant (WIPP) for a defence TRU waste repository in a salt formation is\nlocated in New Mexico at a depth of 700m. The 1985 Nuclear Waste Policy Act gave the go\nahead for the search of potential sites for a deep repository to take HLW and civilian TRU\nwaste. In 1987 the law was amended to direct the US Department of Energy to evaluate only\nthe Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. Site characterization began in July 1991 and construction\nof a URL (known here as the Experimental Studies Facility or ESF) has now started. Should\nthe site prove acceptable, a licence application will be made to construct a repository. The\nearliest waste emplacement operations would begin is 2010. The Department of Energy is\nintending to build a monitorable retrievable store (MRS) to serve as a holding facility until\nthe repository is ready. No site for this has yet been identified, but it is hoped that a State\nor Indian Tribe will volunteer to host an MRS.\nBelgium\nBelgium, which has some of its fuel reprocessed, intends to dispose of its HLW and alpha-\nbearing wastes in a deep-clay formation at Mol-Dessel nuclear site. A 230m deep URL has\nbeen in operation there since 1984 (known as HADES and part-financed by the EC). Should\nexperiments in the URL show the site to be satisfactory, it is intended to begin repository\n                                                                                                                                                                           \n37\n In this journal extract TRU is the acronym for tans-uranic waste, ie waste from the break-down of uranium\natoms in a nuclear reactor which are themselves radioactive. In other parts of this Research Paper the term\nfission products is used.\n23\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nconstruction in 2030 and commence disposal in 2040, subject of course to a successful\nlicensing process.\nCanada\nThe Canadian concept is that HLW disposal should be in stable granite formations of the\nCanadian Shield at a depth of between 500-1000m. A major component of the disposal\nprogramme is the URL at Lac du Bonnet batholith near the Whiteshell Laboratories at Pinawa,\nManitoba, 100km from Winnipeg. Excavation of this commenced in 1986 and is now below\n400m. It is not intended that Whiteshell becomes the eventual repository, but it will provide\nthe geological characterization methodology for candidate sites.\nA very lengthy environmental assessment of a generic repository design is required prior to\nthe submission of the proposal for a site-specific facility. Subject to this, it is planned to have\nan actual repository operational by 2025.\nJapan\nSince 1977, the Japanese have been running a site selection procedure for a deep repository.\nA number of underground experiments have been carried out at existing quarries, an uranium\nmine and other underground facilities. A dedicated URL on the north island is intended, but\nadoption of a new policy in 1992 means that this will not be the final repository. HLW\ndisposal will not take place for may decades to come.\nSpain\nSpain commenced an HLW repository site selection programme in 1986 - a final choice is to\nbe made by the year 2000. Construction is planned to start in 2015 leading to a repository\noperational date of 2020. Generic design are being considered for a repository in salt, granite\nand clay formations; two have been developed. When a decision has been made by the\nGovernment on the rock type to be used, an initial validation laboratory will be excavated, but\nthis would not necessarily be the repository site.\nFinland\nIn Finland, after an initial screening exercise for a spent-fuel repository in the mid-1980s, five\nsites were chosen for preliminary investigation. This was completed at the end of 1992 and\nthree of these have now been designated for detailed field studies to the year 2000. One site\nwill then be chosen for supplementary investigations until 2010. A licence application will\nfollow with commissioning planned for the year 2020. This repository will take the fuel from\nOlkiluoto. The fuel from the Soviet-built Loviisa power station will be returned to Russia\nfor reprocessing, but there is no intention for any associated wastes to be returned to Finland.\nSweden\nBetween 1980 and 1992, Sweden ran an international URL project in a 400m deep abandoned\niron-ore mine at Stripa. The project was wound down and a new project begun below the\n24\n\n\nResearch Paper 96/113\nisland of Äspö. This is planned to continue until the year 2010. Construction of the access\ntunnel commenced in 1990 and is currently below 200m, with an eventual depth of 500m.\nSweden began looking for a final deposal site for HLW in 1977. Eight sites have been\nstudied closely and two or three sites are due to be selected this year for more detailed\ncharacterization. A final selection will be made at the end of the century with the intention\nof starting spent-fuel disposal in 2008 - two years ahead of the planned date for reactor\nclosure, decided following a referendum. A repository at Äspö, incorporating laboratory\nexcavations, is unlikely. However this would not preclude the choice of another site in the\nregion.\nSwitzerland\nThe Swiss intended to reprocess some fuel in France and the UK. They will dispose of the\nreturned waste in a 1200m deep HLW repository, which will be ready for operation by 2020.\nThe site selection programme is at present looking at four sites in the north of the country,\nwith one being selected for further detailed characterization in 1997. A deep URL will be\nconstructed at that location. In the meantime, since 1984, underground experiments have been\ncarried out at the Grimsel test site in the Alps, but this will not be a repository location. The\nfacility is situated about 1km inside the mountain which provides a 450m rock overburden.\n25\n\n\nSubject Headings:\nEnergy\nEnvironmental Issues\nScience and Technology\n\n\nRecent Research Papers on related subjects include:\n94/31  The Nuclear Review 17.02.96 \n95/03 Nuclear Privatisation 15.01.96 \n96/30 Radioactive Waste: Some Topical Issues 29.02.96\n96/83 Decommission of Nuclear Power Stations 1994/95) 18.07.96 \n  \n\n\n\n"],"description_s":["The underground disposal of radioactive waste.
